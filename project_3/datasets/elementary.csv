,elementary,"I get that many people here are anti-Joanlock.

I understand that perspective after watching everything up to season 6 ep 12.

But I've got a revised proposal for you: what about marriage?

I think marriage, romance, and attraction are all different. And I agree that Joan and Sherlock don't display that lover's spark (of course whether the spark could appear later on is a different question).

But they have a good partnership and I think they would raise children well. Don't you think they would be a great married couple? Shouldn't they have been married by the end?!

I think this is a very unconventional idea: two people who love each other and don't sleep together get married and have kids, pay less taxes, look after each other in old age. I think this is something that all the ""platonic partnerships can exist!"" people can agree with as well. Yes? Maybe?

If I can't have Joanlock, I NEED married Joan and Sherlock. In fact, I don't care about their romantic status. I just care about whether they are married or not.

&lt;p&gt;I understand that perspective after watching everything up to season 6 ep 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve got a revised proposal for you: what about marriage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think marriage, romance, and attraction are all different. And I agree that Joan and Sherlock don&amp;#39;t display that lover&amp;#39;s spark (of course whether the spark could appear later on is a different question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they have a good partnership and I think they would raise children well. Don&amp;#39;t you think they would be a great married couple? Shouldn&amp;#39;t they have been married by the end?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very unconventional idea: two people who love each other and don&amp;#39;t sleep together get married and have kids, pay less taxes, look after each other in old age. I think this is something that all the &amp;quot;platonic partnerships can exist!&amp;quot; people can agree with as well. Yes? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can&amp;#39;t have Joanlock, I NEED married Joan and Sherlock. In fact, I don&amp;#39;t care about their romantic status. I just care about whether they are married or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

WGN America has cracked the case of “Elementary,” acquiring rerun rights to CBS’ detective drama.

The Tribune Co. cabler’s deal for the Sherlock Holmes’ procedural follows on the heels of its purchase of rights to another CBS drama, “Person of Interest,” from Warner Bros. TV. The deals are part of the effort by the new regime at Tribune to make over WGN America into a home for original and acquired drama series.

The WGN America pact also ensures that “Elementary,” now in its second year, will be renewed for a third season on CBS (not that there was much doubt). The rerun window on WGN America is expected to begin after the show wraps its junior year on the network. “Person of Interest” reruns are also skedded to bow in 2015.

I think this is ridiculous! Absolute nonsense! Platonic partners who live together, work together, raise a child together and love each other? Sounds like a married couple who never got their honeymoon. And so unrealistic too. Is Elementary Rob Doherty's response to When Harry Met Sally?

Upon looking at the lyrics of the song, however, we discover that it is much more than a soundtrack, and that this was only the first of countless occasions where Elementary plays a song that fits perfectly into the context.

The song is called ""Young Blood"", by ""The Naked And Famous"". The part that plays starts ""The bittersweet between my teeth, trying to find the in-betweens..."". While I don't exactly understand the meaning of this sentence (which is to say explanations are more than welcome), the onset of the original song is very meaningful. It starts as follows: 'We're only young and naive still, we require certain skills..."". Although this part does not play in the show, I cannot be convinced that the music choice is a pure coincidence.

Considering the general theme of growth and development in the show and the huge contrast between what the show opens with versus what it closes with regarding the personalities of its characters, the onset of the song is a perfect and delicious choice. ""We're only young and naive still"", Joan and Sherlock are far from naive, but in the shadow of what kind of people they will become gradually through the show, the word can be relatively applicable. Also, neither of the two is particularly young, but they grow almost 12 years during the show, which also makes the word 'young' relatively applicable. The following part, ""We require certain skills"", foreshadows the skills Sherlock and Joan are destined to develop during the course of their partnership, namely and mainly those skills of deduction and detection of Joan, and those of social adaptation and self-containment of Sherlock.

Below are full lyrics of the song:

We're only young and naïve still

We require certain skills

The mood it changes like the wind

Hard to control when it begins

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws

Claw my way out through these walls

One temporary escape

Feel it start to permeate

We lie beneath the stars at night

Our hands gripping each other tight

You keep my secrets hope to die

Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As it withers, brittle it shakes

Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?

As you shiver, count up all your mistakes

Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late

Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The bittersweet between my teeth

Can you whisper?

Trying to find the in-betweens

Can you whisper?

Fall back in love eventually

Can you whisper?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

&amp;#x200B;

I can also remember the song from S02E01 as the duo are entering London in a black cab, the song play ""I don't feel as if I know you..."", in an expression to Sherlock's recent Esrtangment from his hometown.

Anyway, so The Office community, Sherlock community, Spider-Man community, and many others are themed with a profile picture and a cover. This makes it look ten times nicer and better. It also helps in setting a very nice place that is deserving of our favorite show. 

So, if anyone knows something I don't know about that, or if any of the two moderators read that, please try to do something about it. 

It is worth mentioning that I am usually perfectionist enough to look for the best pictures possible for situations like this, so I can help to reduce the difficulty of choosing some good pictures.

Where Sherlock and Watson first meet and the first thing he says to her face is a line that he had just memorized in his memory game  - sorry, ""it's not a game, it's an exercise. I remember"". So, I had, in the past, tried several times probably to find out what TV show was that Sherlock Holmes quoted when he said **""Do you believe in love at first sight? I know what you're thinking; the world is a cynical place and I must be a cynical man, thinking that a woman like you would fall for a line like that. Thing is, it isn't a line. So, please hear me when I say, that I have never loved anyone as I do you, right now, at this moment""**. However, I was never able to find any satisfying results in my internet research. I know that ""curiosity killed the cat"", but I'd really love to know, especially that the actress is oddly familiar to me if I am not mistaken. I don't know what the odds are that anyone would know, but if anyone does, then, by all means, enlighten me. Thanks.

Do you remember this scene from the pilot? Where Sherlock and Watson first meet and the first thing he says to her face is a line that he had just memorized in his memory game  - sorry, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not a game, it&amp;#39;s an exercise. I remember&amp;quot;. So, I had, in the past, tried several times probably to find out what TV show was that Sherlock Holmes quoted when he said &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Do you believe in love at first sight? I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking; the world is a cynical place and I must be a cynical man, thinking that a woman like you would fall for a line like that. Thing is, it isn&amp;#39;t a line. So, please hear me when I say, that I have never loved anyone as I do you, right now, at this moment&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, I was never able to find any satisfying results in my internet research. I know that &amp;quot;curiosity killed the cat&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;d really love to know, especially that the actress is oddly familiar to me if I am not mistaken. I don&amp;#39;t know what the odds are that anyone would know, but if anyone does, then, by all means, enlighten me. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"So we know the original story ""His last bow"" and it is clear that ""bow"" in this context is a metaphor. But what exactly the metaphor that ""bow"" can serve in English is not quite clear to me. I had thought earlier that it could have been a reference from the late Conan Doyle to the bow of Holmes's violin, and that this way the word ""bow"" would probably mean ""the final melody played in his career"", so to speak. It sounded like a plausible interpretation, but there was noting to confirm it. With the Elementary series finale being titled ""Their Last Bow"", however, I started to wonder. It seemed that ""bow"" here is either a mere reference to the original story or that the word itself has a fixed metaphorical meaning in English that I could not find on Google. Generally, I do understand what the word is supposed to mean in the context; an event, a phase, a telling of a story, but I would be very much interested to know that the word ""bow"" does indeed have a fixed metaphorical meaning; and if so, where does it come from and what is the explanation?   
Thanks to all the beautiful Elementary fans in advance.

Sherlock stops at the door and looks puzzled. ‘Detective I fail to see why you would need our help. A dinner party turned heated argument, a thorough canvassing of Mr Watanabes life and a matching of the prints will produce the killer.’ Sherlock gestures with his hands, ‘It’s all a bit mundane is it not?’

Bell looks exasperated, ‘I didnt ask you here to help with the murder, I asked you here to see this.’ Bell gestures at the kitchen table.

Sherlock and Joan look at each other and head to the kitchen table. Bell opens the laptop that was sitting on the table. The screen blinks into life and pictures of Sherlock and Joan appear on the screen.

Watson gasps.

‘To continue the cooking metaphor Watson, the plot has indeed thickened’

Cut to the brownstone.

Sherlock stands by his printer waiting for a new sheet to finish. Taking the sheet he proceeds to the wall of evidence display and pins it up. Watson comes in and stands next to Sherlock.

‘Mr Wantanabe was a moderator for an online forum only recently created. They have taken to calling themselves the irregular irregulars. A group dedicated to finding out more about us and our work.’

‘Well that is creepy’

‘Indeed Watson, despite our best efforts to avoid the limelight it would appear word of our exploits is now grist for the cheap voyeurism that passes for entertainment.’

Watson walks up to the display and reads off of one sheet, ‘“Joan Watson’s top five outfits. Is Joan Sherlocks lover.” We need to stop this.’

‘Fear not Watson by the end of this case I will have dismantled this group and returned our lives to the privacy we are due. I will not let some secret cabal of internet sleuths put our lives on display for their own edification.’

‘Where do we start?’

Sherlock rips down one particular sheet and hands it to Joan.

Joan reads then looks up at  Sherlock, ‘Harlan Emple gave them an interview?!’

‘I believe it is time we paid Harlan a visit and gave him a refresher on what the word secrecy should mean.’

Cut to cab ride.

Sherlock's phone rings and is placed on speaker phone. ‘Detective?’

‘Hey prints came back and you're not going to believe this. These prints have been turning up at crime scenes for the last few years. FBI have profiled this killer to be an international assassin. Their M.O. is to use everyday items to kill the victims. Seems Mr wantanabe must be mixed up with some pretty powerful players.’

‘Watson and I are on route to an irregular who may have some information. We will keep you apprised of what we find.’

Sherlock puts the phone away. ‘It may be time to reassess my relationship with Mr Emple.’

Cut to Harlan Emple’s apartment block.

Sherlock and Joan approach the door and notice it is open. Sherlock slows and nods at Joan. Joan takes out her baton and extends it with a flick of the wrist. Sherlock presses himself to the wall and edges up to the door. With one hand he pushes the door open and quickly takes a peek. Then, when nothing happens, they both enter. 

‘Harlan?’ asks Sherlock loudly.

Harlan's apartment is trashed.

‘Looks like there was a struggle.’ notes Watson.

Sherlock kneels down to examine the flecks of blood on the ground.

‘Sherlock.’, Watson is pointing to the table. On the table is a note with Sherlock's name on. Watson reads the note. ‘I knew you would arrive first.

,elementary,"Rather than introducing a completely new villain in the final season and ultimately leaving the Moriarty arc open-ended, wouldn't a better idea have been to center the whole final season around Moriarty? They already started building up something in season six. Why not continue it throughout the season seven, until the final showdown?


In the interview, Robert Doherty explained that they didn't even try getting Natalie Dormer to appear in the finale, fearing that the Moriarty arc would take the attention away from Sherlock and Joan. *But the entire final season-up until the final episode-was focused on all that master villain plot anyway.* Only the final episode was (mostly) all about Sherlock, Joan, their partnership etc. Why not have that villain be Moriarty, rather than Odin Reichenbach, who we had never seen before? They could have still found a way to tie up the Moriarty arc by the episode twelve, and then focus on Sherlock and Joan, and the aftermath, in the final episode.


I know that Moriarty actually wasn't *that* big of a deal in the original stories, and was only created as a plot device to kill Sherlock off. But ""Elementary"" turned her into an extremely interesting and multilayered character, and Natalie Dormer was great in that role. If any villain deserved to be the focus of the final season, it was Moriarty. They didn't necessarily have to kill her off or even incarcerate her for life at the end, just develop an actual plot from all that build-up in the previous season and provide some closure.

To be fair, the writers kind of wrote themselves into a corner, because they established (pretty early on) that Moriarty would never actually kill Sherlock or Joan. They are the only two people that can match up her wits and intelligence. Moriarty has always been their foe, but never really their threat. But she was still willing to have Sherlock's father killed in order to get her organization back, and they teased her return throughout season six (and seven). So I'm sure that the writers could have figured something out.

And what was the point of Joan adopting a kid? Knowing how busy she is, he will probably end up being raised by a nanny more often than not.


Also, why did Moriarty fake her death? To get away from her enemies? To get Sherlock and Joan to let their guard down? To get back at Sherlock for doing the same?


There were only four good things about the finale IMO:


• Joan having finally written and published ""The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes""

• the way Moriarty lured Sherlock out of hiding was clever, sneaky, and it really seemed like something she would do (too bad that didn't lead anywhere)

• seeing agent McNally back was nice

• the ending, with ""As long as we're together, what does it matter?""

'He wanted to fly before breakfast' says Sherlock matter of factly.

Watson sighs and heads for the coffee machine, 'Clyde told you that?'

'It is obvious what Clyde wants, if one is willing to listen.'

Sherlock's mobile phone rings, 'Detective?....we will be on our way.'

Cut to apartment





Sherlock and Watson enter the apartment and head to the kitchen. Detective Bell and several other cops are inspecting the crime scene. The body of a dead man lies in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor.

'Victim is Takeshi Watanabe, this is his flat, no murder weapon has turned up. No signs of forced entry so I figure he must have known the person that stabbed him. Stab wound looks weird though, it wasn't made with a knife.'

Sherlock stands over the body examining the details. Looking up Sherlock moves over to the pots on the stove. 

Bell looks at him quizzically, 'you hungry?'

'This pot is still warm', Sherlock opens the pot and acrid smoke drifts out, 'its boiled dry, was the burner still on when you arrived?'

Bell checks his notes, 'yeah responding unit came after a report of smoke and found our victim. They turned the stove off, figured the victim was stabbed while cooking.'

Sherlock takes a deep smell of the burnt food and smiles. Moving back to the victim Sherlock gets on his knees and takes a deep smell of the victims stab wound. Bell looks on horrified at Holmes.

'No detective Mr Wantanabe wasn't stabbed while cooking, the murderer left that pot on.'

'The killer cooked some food before fleeing? That doesn't make sense Holmes.'

'No detective, the wound, it smells of fish.'

'He was stabbed with a fish?' says Bell disbelievingly.

'Exactly, but not just any fish, Katsuobushi.'

'Katsuobushi… that's a Japanese dried fermented fish' says Joan.

'Yes,' Sherlock replies, 'usually added to meals as shaved flakes but in its original form it is renowned as one of the hardest foods. Perfectly adequate to stab someone with...'

'...and the murderer left the fish boiling in the pot to destroy the evidence…'

'Exactly Watson' turning to Bell, 'I might suggest you dust the pot for fingerprints.'

'I will get CSU on it' turning away Bell makes a call on his radio.

'Do you see Watson, a good detective needs a range of skills to solve crimes.'

'Did you write a monograph on identifying dried fish?'

If you haven't watched S07, stop reading.

I got into the show pretty late (Aug 2019) but I have been watching almost daily and finally finished today. 

Honestly, I loved this show. I didn't have any serious problems with the show until I watched S07. I don't know where to start, there's many threads discussing why finale was underwhelming, etc but I want to rant about one thing that i find super annoying.

Moriarty plot.

Up until her appearance on my screen, I had never watched Natalie Dormer. Many of you might be surprised but it is what it is. I was completely blown away by her performance. Acting felt authentic and her scenes with Sherlock were amazing. She's my favourite character.

The frustrating part is, she just disappears. While watching right till the end I was always waiting for her. How would Sherlock and her paths cross again? What did she want from Sherlock (and Joan)? I was expecting at least a cameo once in a season or maybe a regular full season role. 

Then there's Producer Rob Doherty explaining his [seriously dumb reason](https://i.imgur.com/dncQB9o.png) I mean why would you keep banging the Moriarty drum if you have no intention of bringing her back? Make up something like:  
1.  Morland dismantled the group. Group is too weak, M is now only dealing in art.  
2. Or when Morland dies, Sherlock becomes the head, he fights with Moriarty for control of the group.  

You get my point, the possibilities with this show are endless.

My understanding on the matter is Dormer is simply too expensive and they couldn't afford her. I can't think of any other reason to not include her.

,elementary,"Spoilers, obviously. Don’t read if you haven’t seen S7, E13 and the rest of S7.

So, I _just_ finished binging season 7, and I thought the season, _overall_, was **fantastic**. There was so much tension built up with a variety of sub-plots. The whole Odin chaotic good supercriminal anti-hero thingamajig, Sherlock’s father dying, and a surprising return of Moriarty, someone we hadn’t heard from in a long while. I was so damn excited seeing Moriarty be mentioned again. Would we see the return of Natalie Dormer? Well, most likely not. I believe she confirmed she didn’t have time to return to the show a while back. And besides, wasn’t Moriarty’s plot resolved anyway? Why bring it back in the first place, especially when it’s left with so much unresolved tension? Come to think of it, it really doesn’t make much sense to bring this subplot back when they couldn’t even get the original actress to return, and even still, they could’ve done _something_ with it. I’m _still_ confused as to what the whole Moriarty subplot was about in this season’s last one or two episodes, and I just finished watching them.

But the last few episodes of the season, especially the season finale (E13), wrap it up so awkwardly. Moriarty is back, and, like, an episode later, there’s a one-year time skip, and suddenly, Moriarty’s dead. But she’s _not_ dead, according to Sherlock—obviously. She faked her death! How intriguing! And that’s it. The season’s over. We’re not getting a season 8. That’s quite the cliffhanger there.

There’s also the whole NSA Agent McNally ordeal. The wrap-up with that subplot felt very rushed. The NSA has taken part in inhumane crimes, and Agent McNally saw no repercussions for what he’d done. Now he’s trying to recruit Sherlock. Sherlock denies it, and that’s it, apparently.

I love Elementary. It’s one of my favourite shows. But the season 7 finale felt pretty underwhelming. I feel like there are a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of things that left me wanting. A Sherlock Holmes show without Sherlock faking his death at one point wouldn’t be a Sherlock Holmes show—it’s a classic! But in the end, he just walks as a free man. Sherlock faking his death _was_ exciting, but I felt like it solved everything much more quickly than it should’ve.

And what about the Joan having cancer thing? One minute, we, along with Sherlock, find out that Joan has cancer in an eye-watering scene. The next minute, it’s a year later, and she’s cancer-free. What’s that about? With the cancer thing, the Agent McNally resolution, the Joan/Moriarty funeral fake-out, and so on, it feels like the show’s creators had a competition for who could crowd the finale with as many lead-ups, twists, and conclusions as humanly possible.

Honestly, I just feel like season 7 was rushed. It started off so great, and the majority of the season was fantastic, but to me, I get the feeling that the creators of the show realized they were running out of budget and just wanted to get it done as soon as possible. This is made clear by the fact that season 7 only had 13 episodes, whereas all other seasons of the show had 24 episodes, except season 6, which had 21 episodes, and that’s still a lot more than 13.

This post has a lot of rambling, but I hope my points get across at least in some way. To sum it up: While I loved season 7, I did not love the finale. It felt rushed. It felt like I was left hanging. I didn’t feel satisfied like I did when I watched season 6’s finale. Despite how much I enjoyed season 7 as a whole, I almost wish that the show ended on season 6. Now, _that_ was a satisfying ending. All the answers about &gt;!the entire Michael serial killer subplot that went on throughout the entire season!&lt; were answered, and it felt like Joan and Sherlock had a whole new adventure in front of them. That’s what a season finale _should_ be. Not one with rushed twists and conclusions, unanswered questions, and just overall confusion.

,elementary,"To be clear, I love Elementary.  I've read and watched Sherlock Holmes for decades, and I've never cared much for it.  Sherlock was usually less a character than a caricature, and Watson was rarely more than a useless buffoon.  Sherlock stories were good for a bit of fun but not anything I could get invested in.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came Elementary.  This show did so many things that impressed me I couldn't begin to list them all, but the most important was the characters.  For the first time, Sherlock and Watson felt like actual people.  Heck, the people around them felt more fleshed out and compelling than Sherlock and Watson had ever been before.  The writing, the casting, the acting, all made for something I could never have imagined.  Even Moriaty, a lazy and boring character (evil mirrors of characters always are) in the source material became intriuging.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on for ages praising the show, but this is what Season 7 got wrong.  Not with the main cast, with the villain.  From the moment he was introduced, Odin was portrayed as brilliant.  Sherlock's first comments on him are to say he's downplaying his genius.  Throughout the season, we're told he's the biggest and most threatening villain ever, able to influence governments and take down the leader of Moriarty's organization.  And on top of that, we're told about how he even had an interesting motive.

&amp;#x200B;

But the writing shows all of that to be a lie.  Odin wasn't smart.  He wasn't clever.  We weren't shown a single thing to justify the hype.  Aside from the trick he played before they knew he was a bad guy, Odin didn't fool Sherlock a single time.  Not only did he fail to trick Sherlock, each time he tried, he failed miserably.  The only reason Odin posed any sort of threat was he had magic powers.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean that literally.  Computer hacking in Elementary was never realistic, but usually it was unimportant to the plot.  Yeah, the NSA hacked into their PCs to hijack a livestream and delete files from their harddrive, which is impossible, but I can forgive that.  The same thing could have been done by having agents show up at the brownstone.  Similarly, Everyone being able to hack into servers to get information on a whim is completely unrealistic, but that information could have been gathered in other ways that'd have taken a bit more screen time.  It's lazy writing, but it's forgivable because it doesn't change anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are different in Season 7.  Odin's impossible to believe hacking tools are central to the season's plot.  Having the villain of the season be based entirely on lazy writing is a problem.  Odin wants to talk to Sherlock but can't risk being recorded?  Just give him a magic device that magically disables electronics in the area, a tool which never showed up before or again after.  Odin gets targeted by Moriarty's group and loses the season-long struggle?  Just give him magic powers that let him frighten the powerful criminal organization he never even knew existed so much they immediately surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

THe worst thing is to make this lazy writing work, our characters have to be turned into idiots.  Defeating Odin could have been as simple as telling the world he uses his position to spy on people for purposes of insider trading.  We see with Morland's plans if Odin loses the protection of his company, he can go to jail.  So... tell the world.  Heck, frame him if necessary.  We saw once an investigation began Odin lost so... why not frame him for insider trading.  Heck, tell the world he kills people who gets in the way of business deals.  It's the truth, and even just the rumor of it would ruin Odin's plans.

&amp;#x200B;

I could rant for ages about this.  Everything about Odin was lazy and dumb.  The writers couldn't come up with a threatening villain so they resorted to magic in the form of, ""He has technology.""  We never see anything from Odin that is smart, clever or dangerous beyond, ""I have magic.""  When confronted with Morland, he wins because magic.  Then he somehow loses with an idiotic plan that shouldn't have ever worked.  Then we have the finale which is filled with things like, ""I relapsed; I got better"" and, ""I got cancer; I got better.""  And remember how Morland was told Odin was a new thing, making Moriarty's organization a dionsaur?  Yeah, despite that and despite Sherlock fighting it for three years, somehow Moriarty's organization is thriving.  Morland died for no reason.  It was just to make Odin seem scarier with his magical powers... that somehow failed him in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good things about Season 7.  Miss Understood is one of my favorite episodes.  The acting in the finale made me want to tear up.  There are plenty more examples, but Season 6 ended with pure idiocy as nobody could have ever believed Watson was guilty, and Season 7 took that idiocy and ran with it as hard as it could.

To some extent I agree it did wrap up nicely in season 6 but i consider season 7 like an extra treat after a full course meal. This might be a terrible analogy but even after the full binge of 1-6 i had room for a little more just to be greedy.  The ending didn&amp;#39;t feel like a real final but i&amp;#39;m glad it didn&amp;#39;t.

If i had to point to something that bothered me the most, id say that i feel like we werent really given an end to a Story. There is absolutely no reason ended. I mean i get that TV Shows end, but in universe it feels like more or less an arbitrary cut off point.

,elementary,"I found the following passage in a book of essays by W. H. Auden, which I thought might be of interest to members of this subreddit:

&gt;All characters who are products of the mythopoeic imagination are instantaneously recognizable by the fact that their existence is not defined by their social and historical context; transfer them to another society or another age and their characters and behavior will remain unchanged. In consequence, once they have been created, they cease to be their author's characters and become the reader’s; he can continue their story for himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anna Karenina is not such a character for the reader cannot imagine her apart from the particular milieu in which Tolstoy places her or the particular history of her life which he records; Sherlock Holmes, on the other hand, is: every reader, according to his fancy, can imagine adventures for him which Conan Doyle forgot, as it were, to tell us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tolstoy was a very great novelist, Conan Doyle a very minor one, yet it is the minor not the major writer who possesses the mythopoeic gift. The mythopoeic imagination is only accidentally related, it would seem, to the talent for literary expression; in Cervantes' *Don Quixote* they are found together, in Rider Haggard's *She* literary talent is largely absent. Indeed, few of the writers whom we call great have created mythical characters. In Shakespeare's plays we find five, Prospero, Ariel, Caliban, Falstaff and Hamlet, and Hamlet is a myth for actors only; the proof that, for actors, he is a myth is that all of them without exception, irrespective of age, build, or even sex, wish to play the part.  
&gt;  
&gt;After Cervantes, as a writer who combines literary talent and a mythopoeic imagination, comes Dickens and, of his many mythical creations, Mr. Pickwick is one of the most memorable. Though the appeal of mythical characters transcends all highbrow-lowbrow frontiers of taste, it is not unlimited; every such character is symbolic of some important and perpetual human concern, but a reader must have experienced this concern, even if he cannot define it to himself, before the character can appeal to him.

,elementary,"Hello Fellow...

Alright, look. I don't want to get too emotional but... Nope. I'm going to anyways. Lets get the basics out of the way.

Synopsis- Amidst Holmes and Watson's battle with tech billionaire Odin Reichenbach, the duo receives word of their old enemy and Sherlock's former love, Jamie Moriarty.

So, now let's talk. Listen, this show has been a big part of my life for about 7 years. It started in the first year of my relationship, and I just got married in May! I have so much attachment and I just feel really glad to have been here and shared this show with all you guys. Its been amazing. I grew up with a big old book shelf full of books at my grandparents' house and every summer I would take a Sherlock Holmes book down and read from the time I could barely make out the words(so basically, 3 weeks ago! Ha...)

I've loved these characters. As I became a mod here and later an admin, I loved watching you guys share in it. I've somehow been quoted by blogs and had a bit of my name out in this fandom and met a LOT of fantastic people through this show(all of you, honestly.).

With that said, after this episode is done tonight, I hope you keep coming back. If possible I would like to do 3 things with this sub going forward: 

1.Do a full series weekly rewatch that'll take 3 years.

2.Do an eventual conversion to a greater scope Sherlock Holmes sub that specializes in Elementary and holds this show in the same regard it always has

3.Find new ways to keep this fandom going somehow. Maybe through art or an event or even a charity fundraiser for addiction. Feel free to post some ideas you have here.

But yeah, if you are still so inclined, please keep your eyes on this sub in the post-show. Thanks so much for everything! It was truly an honor to meet you all.

...whew. I didn't let the cat out of the bag about planning a charity anthology of original Elementary stories.

,elementary,"Last night I was watching an old rerun of Elementary and I just became overwhelmed with melancholy. It used to be fun reliving old episodes that I've seen a thousand times. But I started thinking about how that's all it will ever be now. I'll never see them tackle a new case again. Never see a new one of Sherlock's adorable facial expressions, or hear a funny verbal one. Once the finale airs, I'm unsure if I'll be able to watch reruns for a while because they're going to remind me that it's over and bring me sorrow as opposed to the usual joy the show used to bring.

,elementary,"There are several fairly common thematic/genre episodes that I think would have worked really well in ""Elementary"", but they never gave them a try. Some of the missed opportunities are:


 • Halloween episode [Featuring a creepy, complicated case with lots of twists and turns, exploring the possibility of supernatural because duh. Of course, it all has a rational explanation at the end.]

• Christmas episode [It could encourage Sherlock and Joan to discuss religion, and provoke Sherlock to rant about consumerism.]

• Valentine's Day episode [Possible set-up: both Sherlock and Joan have a date scheduled for the Valentine's Day (though with Sherlocj it is maybe more like an arrangement with a call girl). But an important and complicated case comes their way, and they work around the clock to solve it before the Valentine's Day evening. In the end, they do solve the case, but it is too late, and they have both missed their date. They spend the evening watching the old movies together on the rooftop.]

• Anthology episode [Where Sherlock and/or Joan talk about several different cases they have solved together, and the events are told via flashbacks. Bonus points if all the cases mentioned took place over the summer, during the show's hiatus, with Sherlock or Joan remarking: ""Strangely enough, we don't get that many cases in summer."" All of the mysteries could be the adaptations of the original ACD short stories. The set-up could be Sherlock talking about that during a sobriety meeting. He was shown doing that at the beginning of 1x15 ""A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs"", where he told them about the case from one of the original ACD stories, ""The Adventure of the Crooked Man"". Then he suggested telling them about the case of the ""blue carbuncle"".]

• The 9/11 tribute episode [Clearly more somber and serious than the other suggestions, but an interesting theme-the show does take place in the New York City, after all.]


I have been thinking about CSI: New York, another quirky and interesting crime procedural that took place in the New York City (well, duh). They did all of the thematic/genre episodes mentioned above (some of them multiple times), and even some more (such as the one exploring the horrors and impact of the Holocaust, or the one that include the voice-over of the murder victim), and they were all great episodes. It saddens me that ""Elementary"" never gave any of them a try. Though many crime procedural features at least one of such episodes so it is not really original, I think it would have worked really well here. ""Elementary"" definitely had the potential to expand on its quirkiness and ""break the format"" from time to time, but they rarely did anything different. They would include lots of interesting real-life elements/trends/discoveries (mostly in relation to science and popular culture) into almost every episode, but in the end, they were all typical crime procedural episodes in tone and format.

 It's usually what makes a show or a film bad, when you need to make explanations as to what is going on. The problem here is that you don't even have to do that - one example I just watched is someone is found to have a married name and Watson jumps in to say 'you weren't hiding the truth from your employer, you were trying to hide your adultery from your husband' - it was very unnatural since it was so straightforward as to what the implication was that no one in the scene needed for that to be articulated, I resent the fact that the writers think that the people who watch Sherlock are the laziest and stupidest individuals who need everything basic occurrence on the show narrated. It actually takes away the pleasure of watching this show from me a little bit, because I find the show to be condescending to the viewer (and I have no problem with explanations that are needed, I have a problem with the most basic statements that are very clear to everyone who is watching, but the producers feel the need to highlight through someone's words).

,elementary,"Elementary to me has been one of the best Sherlock Holmes series there is. I love this series as much as i loved Jeremy Brett's Sherlock, not overlooking the first two season of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock but i love Elementary more. The cases that come up with each episode is some of the most intelligent writing i have seen from a long runnning crime show. 

And ofcourse, there is Lucy Liu(playing Watson) and Johnny Lee Miller(playing Sherlock) who have just embodied the characters perfectly. 

Miller playing a consultant detective with demons of his own,struggling with his addiction, seeing how Lucy Liu's Watson has just eased him into his life in New York which Sherlock ends up cherishing so much has been a treat and has played the role of Sherlock with absolute and sincere conviction.Detective Marcus played by Jon Michael Hill has been a gem, the respect Sherlock and Watson have for him is just beautiful to watch. Caption Gregson played by Aidan Quinn has been great, a friend in need and a character who is wise and at the same time flawed.

Last but not the least, Lucy Liu, for me she is the best Watson that there can be, she is the invisible fabric that holds up this show.

Everytime i watch an episode i get the same feeling when i first started reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, which for me is more than i could hope for and doing it for 7 seasons.

&lt;p&gt;Everytime i watch an episode i get the same feeling when i first started reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, which for me is more than i could hope for and doing it for 7 seasons. A Sherlock Holmes adaptation with some sincerity, appreciation and intelligent writing to extend the original material is more than i could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Elementary is how Sherlock Holmes should have been adapted for Television.&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"Let's look at the evidence Mallick fixates on: That Michael Rowan uttered Watson's name in a voice message when he is being attacked, thereby implicating Watson in his murder.

Of course, this ignores several things: first it ignores the fact that Rowan was calling William Bazemore, who he knew had committed suicide because that was what had provoked Rowan into attack Watson in the first place. Why would Rowan leave a voicemail somebody he already knew to be dead?

Secondly, Mallick ignores Watson's injury: two broken ribs and a concussion. After receiving them, she went to the hospital to be treated for her injuries. There would be documented evidence of this, and it would have taken her several hours to be treated completely for her injuries and then released. With those injuries, Mallick still believed Watson not only beat Rowan to death, but also transported his body to the dump where it was then found.

Despite all of this, Mallick fixates on a single thing--Rowan saying Watson's name--and decides from there that Watson must have been the perpetrator. In doing so, she ignores all the pieces of evidence that say otherwise, from Rowan leaving a message for somebody he already knew to be dead, to Watson being seriously injured and having to spend time in hospital.

This ultimately comes back around to detection: when the good detectives (Holmes, Watson, Bell, Gregson) work cases, they examine the evidence, and when the evidence doesn't fit, they try to find a new theory that works with the evidence they have. Mallick, on the other hand, fixates on a theory and then attempts to force the evidence to fit the theory, ignoring the evidence that proves contrary to her pet theory.

This makes me think Mallick isn't meant to be just a stubborn FBI agent, but also as a warning as to what happens when somebody does bad detection work, because the effects prove damaging to the principle characters of the show. And because the show is about detection, it only serves to demonstrate how far Watson has come from when she began that she is able to properly weigh the evidence, while a trained investigator is unable to.",t2_9xiz3,False,,0,False,Theory: Special Agent Mallick was meant to be juxtaposed against Holmes and Watson to demonstrate the dangers of a bad detective.,[],r/elementary,False,7,,0,,False,t3_c0dxt7,False,dark,1.0,,public,41,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,41,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1560503073.0,text,7,,,text,self.elementary,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at the evidence Mallick fixates on: That Michael Rowan uttered Watson&amp;#39;s name in a voice message when he is being attacked, thereby implicating Watson in his murder.&lt;/p&gt;

And because the show is about detection, it only serves to demonstrate how far Watson has come from when she began that she is able to properly weigh the evidence, while a trained investigator is unable to.&lt;/p&gt;

Sherlock, like many great detectives, seems quite fond of bizarre, complex, sometimes even gruesome cases/mysteries. Especially unsolved ones. And New York, where Elementary takes place, is a big city with rich history; sadly, that includes criminal history as well. Other than something as obvious as the Son of Sam, what interesting, real-life (not necessarily unsolved) New York City cases/mysteries do you wish Sherlock had mentioned or explored on the show?

Some suggestions:

• Charlie Chop Off. Quite a gruesome and disturbing case from the 70s. Serial killer that would murder and mutilate young African American and Puerto Rican boys (mostly in Manhattan). Officially still unsolved, though the main suspect has been institutionalized for years following an attempted child abduction. The case could have been mentioned in 1x3 ""Child Predator"", the episode that also featured a notorious New York City serial killer targeting children. Probably too gruesome for network TV though. [I've previously written about that case in r/UnresolvedMysteries thread.]

• The case of Dorothy Arnold, wealthy and famous NYC heiress. She was the daughter of Francis J. Arnold, a fine goods importer, Arnold was born and raised inManhattan in an affluent family. On December 12th, 1910, Arnold left to go shopping for a dress and was seen by a cashier as well as a friend on Fifth Avenue. She told the friend that she had planned to walk through Central Park before returning home. That was the last time anyone saw her alive. What followed was countless man-hours by the police and family, tracking her last moves on the final day of her vanishing, and a frenzy of attention by newspapers around the country. Newspapers followed the case and the seemingly endless bevy of vague leads and tips day-by-day. And yet, despite the immense publicity that the case engendered and the prolonged investigation which lasted for years, no concrete theory was ever established to justify her disappearance.

Years after Dorothy Arnold disappeared, numerous alleged sightings from all over the United States were still being reported. Police continued to investigate the reports, but all proved to be false. The Arnold family also continued to receive letters from women claiming to be Dorothy Arnold. These were also investigated and also proved to be false. One such letter came from an attorney inCalifornia who claimed that Dorothy was living as ""Ella Nevins"" in Los Angeles, a claim that her father disputed. The case gained attention again on April 8, 1921, when ""during a lecture in New York, Captain John H. Ayers of the Bureau of Missing Persons claimed that Dorothy Arnold's fate had been known to the Bureau and her family for some time. Ayers refused to elaborate and would not say if Arnold was alive or dead. The following day, Ayers claimed that he was misquoted and denied that Arnold's fate was known.


In the weeks following his daughter's disappearance, Francis Arnold spent approximately $250,000 trying to find his daughter. He continued to maintain that he believed Dorothy had been kidnapped and murdered on the day she disappeared or shortly thereafter. Francis Arnold died on April 6, 1922. In his will, he intentionally made no provisions for Dorothy stating that he was ""...satisfied that she is not alive."" According to the Arnold family attorney, John S. Keith, Dorothy's mother Mary Arnold did not share her husband's opinion that their daughter had been kidnapped and murdered, and remained hopeful that she was still alive. Mary Arnold died on December 29, 1928. Shortly after Mary Arnold's death, John S. Keith publicly stated he believed that Arnold had committed suicide because of her failed writing career.

In an obituary for Mary Arnold, United Press Associations (now UPI) referenced the hunt for Dorothy Arnold as ""the really great search of the age, and one that did much to develop modern newspaper 'police' coverage.""

Come to think of it, the case itself could have been incorporated into ""Elementary"" case of the week. A private investigator or a reporter who was looking into the Dorothy Arnold case is murdered, so Sherlock and Joan start looking into 100+ yeaes old mystery hoping to find some sort of a lead that would help them solve the recent murder. Or a human skeletom matching Dorothy Arnold's physical description, with the remains of her old clothing on it, is found buried in Central Park, and Sherlock and Joan have to determine are those really her remains, and what happenes to her. In the end, it may turn out that it was all an elaborate ploy set up by someone hoping to collect an award for finding the body and solving over a century old mystery... or a very ambitious young reporter/investigative journalist in a desperate need for big break.

• On May 23rd 1997, Daphne Abdela and Christopher Vasquez brutally murdered their much older acquaintance and drinking-buddy, Michael McMorrow. The crime occurred late at night, in  Central Park. Abdela and Vasquez stabbed McMorrow at least six times, slit his throat, gutted and eviscerated him, filled his stomach with rocks, and dumped his body in a nearby lake. Both perpetrators were just fifteen years old at the time. The murder was sometimes described as a real-life werewolf attack, not just due to its brutality, but also because it literally occurred on the night of the full moon. Despite the savage nature of the crime, both teenagers were only found guilty of manslaughter, sentenced to ten years in prison, and paroled after serving six. They both still live in New York City.


Daphne Abdela's biological parents died in a car accident when she was still an infant, and she was soon adopted by a wealthy married couple; Angelo, a food-company executive, and Catherine, French-born model. Many suspect that her adoptive parents' wealth and influence helped her and her friend receive such light sentences. Her lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, previously represented Michael Jackson during the 1993 sexual abuse trial, and is currently representing Harvey Weinstein.

That seems like a perfect case to mention during a Halloween-themed episode (if ""Elementary"" ever had one). Otherwise, it may be mentioned by Sherlock, as yet another evidence that the law doesn't work the same for wealthy people (and people with wealthy parents, anyway), which he is known to bring up.

The case could have also been mentioned by Sherlock or Joan in the episodes where teenagers were the killers (such as 1x3 ""Child Predator"", 1x7 ""One Way to Get Off"" and 2x4 ""Poison Pen"").

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock, like many great detectives, seems quite fond of bizarre, complex, sometimes even gruesome cases/mysteries. Especially unsolved ones. And New York, where Elementary takes place, is a big city with rich history; sadly, that includes criminal history as well. Other than something as obvious as the Son of Sam, what interesting, real-life (not necessarily unsolved) New York City cases/mysteries do you wish Sherlock had mentioned or explored on the show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Charlie Chop Off. Quite a gruesome and disturbing case from the 70s. Serial killer that would murder and mutilate young African American and Puerto Rican boys (mostly in Manhattan). Officially still unsolved, though the main suspect has been institutionalized for years following an attempted child abduction. The case could have been mentioned in 1x3 &amp;quot;Child Predator&amp;quot;, the episode that also featured a notorious New York City serial killer targeting children. Probably too gruesome for network TV though. [I&amp;#39;ve previously written about that case in &lt;a href=""/r/UnresolvedMysteries""&gt;r/UnresolvedMysteries&lt;/a&gt; thread.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The case of Dorothy Arnold, wealthy and famous NYC heiress. She was the daughter of Francis J. Arnold, a fine goods importer, Arnold was born and raised inManhattan in an affluent family. On December 12th, 1910, Arnold left to go shopping for a dress and was seen by a cashier as well as a friend on Fifth Avenue. She told the friend that she had planned to walk through Central Park before returning home. That was the last time anyone saw her alive. What followed was countless man-hours by the police and family, tracking her last moves on the final day of her vanishing, and a frenzy of attention by newspapers around the country.

,elementary,"*Spoilers*


Personally, I think that season one had a near-perfect character development, not just when it comes to Sherlock and Joan as individual characters but also their partnership, and it ended on a great note. But as early as of season two, the writers seemed to set Sherlock and Joan (and their friendship) back, to an extent. I'm not sure why, though I think I can see how.


Some storylines and conflicts made sense. I can see Joan still caring about the son of a patient that died on her table, and Sherlock urging her to cut ties with him, because he is clearly using her (in episode 2x2 ""Solve For X""). And I can see Joan wanting to date, and encouraging Sherlock to try the same, despite his experience with Irene/Moriarty (in episode 2x3 ""We Are Everyone""). I can also see Sherlock solving the case originally being assigned to Joan, her getting angry with him, and Sherlock letting her look into his cold cases as a way of making it up to her (in 2x6 ""Unnatural Agreement""). [And I personally prefer the first half of season 2 to the second half.]


But plenty of other things just seemed... off. Such as the whole Mycroft thing. Elementary's version of Mycroft was fine, in itself. But I always had hard time believing that Joan we came to know in season one would be attracted to him. Let alone date him despite Sherlock's warnings. [Sherlock's warning about his father was proven correct in season one, after all.] Joan definitely wouldn't have continued dating Mycroft after finding out he was a member of MI6, which led to her being abducted and almost murdered. Heck, I find it hard to believe any woman would continue dating him after being through that. Especially considering that he kept it a secret the whole time. Joan simply doesn't strike me as the type, anyway.


Or the episode where Sherlock finds out that Alistair died. Sherlock spends most of the episode grieving alone, or with other people that knew Alistair. He doesn't really seek Joan's comfort or advice (though he gets the latter anyway); if anything, he seems to be avoiding her. At first, he doesn't even inform her that Alistair died. They don't have a single ""moment"" in such an otherwise emotional episode, dealing with a heavy subject. In season one, Sherlock cried in front of Joan after admitting he had re-lapsed a day after checking into rehab.


Sherlock's behavior in season two finale was also strange, to say the least. I find it hard to believe he would have left Joan and go to London, mere days after she had been abducted. And not contact her for eight months afterwards. He could have been dead, for all she knew. And that plot point was set off by the dreadful Joan/Mycroft romance too.


Then there are little things that stand out. I don't think Joan from season one, who was clearly flattered that Sherlock named a new species of bee after her, would be that annoyed by having two rousters temporarily stay in the brownstone for the purposes of Sherlock's experiment (in 2x16 ""The One Percent Solution""). Sherlock also didn't really strike me as the type to be making immature""cock"" jokes in regards to rousters (he clearly has an immature/juvenile side to him, but come on...).


There are also times when Joan simply seemed indifferent/ disinterested by Sherlock's experiments and hobies (such as the bees at the beginning of 2x12 ""The Diabolical Kind"", or the bombs from 2x17 ""Ears to You""). Not really in line with an aspiring detective and close personal friend of Sherlock that she came to be in the first season. She seemed almost cold towards Sherlock by the end of season two. It was odd.


The tone of the season-and Sherlock/Joan dynamic-was different as well. Season one featured them growing/developing as characters, as well as growing closer, and eventually becoming true friends. Season two featured them drifting apart, to the point that Sherlock basically fled to London.


Things got better in season three, but season two was just odd in that regard, and I don't think the show ever completely re-captured season one dynamic. I actually think that the post season one episodes that came closest to capturing the original-and the best-Sherlock/Joan dynamic are  3x14 ""Female of the Species"" and 3x19 ""One Watson, One Holmes"".

Naturally, it grew substantially, though I suspect he was skimming off most of the gains"") and so Sherlock demands it all back, and the lawyer sends it in gold bars.    
    
    
At 24:39 is when the particular scene begins, and we see three men walk in and deliver ~10 boxes (they're sort of hidden behind Watson and later Henry Baskerville so we don't know the exact number, [but it's 10 or 11 boxes in all](https://imgur.com/Bhft1Xy); two men made three trips and the first man made just the one and then they closed the door behind them so there weren't more on the way). We also see the [first box opened at 25:02](https://imgur.com/eEjgCH9), to show us the gold, and it looks like each box has 6 stacks of bars.  
  
    
It's harder to tell each bar's dimensions (there seem to be two standard types of gold bars commonly in circulation — one deeper, more brick-like, called the [Good Delivery bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Delivery) plus the older-style [ingots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingot) which these clearly aren't, and one slimmer, sort of iphone-sized, [the kilobar](https://www.bullionbypost.co.uk/gold-bars/1-kilo-gold-bar/)). For that, we have a later scene, the [Gold Stonehenge at 32:24](https://imgur.com/3R7Xh6y), where we see that these bars are the latter type. Though he lays out the bars here, we can't accurately count them, because those clearly aren't ALL the bars, hence the need for the initial scene.    
   
Based on the relative dimensions of each case in both scenes, I think each stack in the case is ~5-6 bars high. That means there're 30-36 bars in each case, and 10-11 cases. The current gold price is about £32,500 (=$42,500) for a kilobar. 

  
Which means Sherlock received ~$12.5 million to $16.5 million. Which is IMHO quite a low amount for someone supposed to be so incredibly wealthy. Obviously, this isn't ALL his inheritance, just the money he currently has, separate from his father's money. But still, 15 million dollars is a bit low for Sherlock Holmes. Thoughts?

The strange thing is though, as late as April 2018, there was (is?) a completely different building there:  

TV Show https://i.imgur.com/omCfSr5.jpg?1

StreetView https://i.imgur.com/q2UgK3F.jpg?1

But there is a mystery afoot: in the TV show, there is a red brick building with substantial staircases , but in the Street View, this white building extends further north, and that can be seen in StreetView shots up to April 2018, which is when season 6 first started airing episodes. Supposing this red brick building replaced the white building in the StreetView, it's seems inconceivable that they would demolish the white building and complete the red brick ""221B Baker Street"" in the space of, say, three months? The alternative is that the red brick building is an elaborate CGI creation, but that seems almost as far fetched. I don't know what to think.  

In the screen shot beside the building, the date is Jan 2018, but if you look at this from this view https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5183571,-0.1225477,3a,24.3y,305.83h,90.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sIuAZtwFCqWPkIP4EG7QJLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192 , you can see that the white building is still there as late as April 2018. 

I might hit up the London subreddit and see if anyone who lives nearby can vouch for which building exists in that location right now.

Also, in the second season, 221B was a depicted as sort of a dump https://i.imgur.com/tkEo8xZ.jpg , and now of course it's presented as high class, million plus pound real estate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@51.518754,-0.1233328,3a,75y,183.17h,101.73t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sANnAA1asZEsleCf4a5GV4A!2e0!5s20180401T000000!7i16384!8i8192""&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/@51.518754,-0.1233328,3a,75y,183.17h,101.73t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sANnAA1asZEsleCf4a5GV4A!2e0!5s20180401T000000!7i16384!8i8192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strange thing is though, as late as April 2018, there was (is?) a completely different building there:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV Show &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/omCfSr5.jpg?1""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/omCfSr5.jpg?1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StreetView &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/q2UgK3F.jpg?1""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/q2UgK3F.jpg?1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a mystery afoot: in the TV show, there is a red brick building with substantial staircases , but in the Street View, this white building extends further north, and that can be seen in StreetView shots up to April 2018, which is when season 6 first started airing episodes. Supposing this red brick building replaced the white building in the StreetView, it&amp;#39;s seems inconceivable that they would demolish the white building and complete the red brick &amp;quot;221B Baker Street&amp;quot; in the space of, say, three months? The alternative is that the red brick building is an elaborate CGI creation, but that seems almost as far fetched. I don&amp;#39;t know what to think.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the screen shot beside the building, the date is Jan 2018, but if you look at this from this view &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5183571,-0.1225477,3a,24.3y,305.83h,90.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sIuAZtwFCqWPkIP4EG7QJLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192""&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5183571,-0.1225477,3a,24.3y,305.83h,90.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sIuAZtwFCqWPkIP4EG7QJLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&lt;/a&gt; , you can see that the white building is still there as late as April 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might hit up the London subreddit and see if anyone who lives nearby can vouch for which building exists in that location right now.  &lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"The funniest/wittiest ""Elementary"" lines/quotes, and the most profound ones, and the saddest ones, basically the ones that stand out, the best/most memorable ones, whatever works; this is the thread for them: 


1x1 ""Pilot""


[JOAN and SHERLOCK just had an argument. Eventually, SHERLOCK revealed he had deduced that JOAN quit her job as a surgeon because the patient died on her table. SHERLOCK also explained how he reached that conclusion. JOAN is clearly shaken up by that.]


JOAN: It's so incredible, the way that you can... solve people just by looking at them. 

(Short silence.)

I noticed you don't have any mirrors around here.

SHERLOCK: And what's that supposed to mean?

JOAN: It means I think you know a lost cause when you see one. (*ouch*)


1x9 ""You Do it to Yourself""


[A man, later identified as Trent Anunzio, had been shot in both eyes, his body dumped under the bridge. SHERLOCK, JOAN and BELL are on the scene. SHERLOCK is sick with the flu.]


SHERLOCK: No shell casings, no skull fragments, no gray matter. He [Trent Anunzio] was killed elsewhere, and then dumped here.

BELL: Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

SHERLOCK: A pig's orgasm lasts up to 30 minutes.

JOAN (referring to SHERLOCK's flu): Hey, I'm not your mother, I'm not your nurse, but if you die of exposure out here, I'm pretty sure your father's not gonna send me my next check, okay?


1x10 ""The Leviathan""


SHERLOCK: You make an effort to appear conventional, but I know, Watson, you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the humdrum routine of ordinary life. [This one was actually taken from one of ACD's stories, though reworded slightly.]


1x16 ""Details""


[SHERLOCK recently discovered that his father stopped paying JOAN to be his sober companion months ago. JOAN lied about her contract being renew because she 
wanted to stay with SHERLOCK, because she was interested in his detective work. SHERLOCK confronts her about it, but he isn't mad.]


SHERLOCK:  I have certain funds set aside. You may continue to reside at the brownstone. You may reside elsewhere. You may also consider yourself relieved of any and all confidentiality burdens with regards to my sobrierty. This is an important decision and I encourage you to discuss it with others. Explain what you have been to me, and what I believe you can be to me. A partner. Oh, and lest you think this is an act of charity, a gift from a grateful client, I assure you it is not. I am better with you, Watson. I’m sharper, I’m more focused. Difficult to say why exactly. Perhaps in time I’ll solve that as well.


1x24 ""Heroine""


JAMIE MORIARTY (after revealing her true self to SHERLOCK): You look at people and you see puzzles. I see games. You? You're the game I'll win everytime.


[...]


I would never kill you. Not in a million years. You may not be as unique as you thought, darling, but you're still a work of art. I appreciate art.
What I can do, what I will do, is hurt you. Worse than I did before.
I have reserves of creativity I haven't even begun to tap. So please, for you own good, let me win.


2x2 ""Solve for X""


SHERLOCK: I'm an expert on poisons, Watson. I know virtually everything there is to know about them. But I've come to learn over the last few years that there is nothing on this planet quite so toxic as guilt.


2x3 ""We Are Everyone""


JOAN: Do you think we're cut off from the world?

(SHERLOCK just stares back at her, frowning.)

You know, neither of us dates, neither of us really goes out much. At all, actually.

SHERLOCK: We're not cut off from the world. We're engaged in creating one that's actually worth living in. One that addresses our needs entirely, and eliminates everything extraneous.


2x6 ""An Unnatural Arrangement""


SHERLOCK: Quite frankly, I'm surprised it's taken this long for the captain's marriage to buckle. He's an excellent detective.

JOAN: What does that have to do with it?

SHERLOCK: Well, as you know, detection is a calling, not a job. Hardly leaves one with time left over to sustain the elaborate ruse of marriage.

JOAN: Because, of course, you think marriage is an elaborate ruse.

SHERLOCK: There are other ways to describe it. An unnatural arrangement which forces its participants into an unhealthy monogamy. An accretion of petty fights and resentful compromises which, like Chinese water torture, slowly transforms both parties into howling, neurotic versions of their former selves.


2x12 ""Diabolical Kind""


SHERLOCK's letter to MORIARTY, featured at the beginning of the episode:


SHERLOCK: ""We have spilled much ink, you and I, in our discussion of human connection, and we're no closer to understanding than we were when the correspondence began.

I often feel as if I'm standing on one side of a wide chasm, shouting across, and wondering if the response I hear comes from you, or if it is my own voice echoing back to me.

It seems to me, on my side of the canyon, that the search for unity with another is the source of the world's unhappiness.

I watch as Watson, eager as ever to extract some meaning from the prevailing social conventions, endures a series of curated mating rituals.

It seems to me that she's incrementally less content each time she returns from one.

I conduct myself as though I'm above matters of the heart, chiefly because I have seen them corrode people I respect.

But in my candid moments, I sometimes wonder if I take the stance I do because love, for lack of a better word, is a game I fail to understand, and so I opt not to play.

After all, if I truly had the purity of all my convictions, I wouldn't regret so many of the things I've done.

Nor would I persist, against so many of my better instincts, in this correspondence.

I find you a challenge, one that, in spite of all that you've done, continues to stimulate.

And so the conversation, futile though it may finally be, continues, and we are left to wonder: have we simply failed to find the answers to the questions that preoccupy us, or can they not be answered at all? 

Fortunately for both of us, the world always presents the next diversion, the next elaborate distraction from the problems that vex.""


...


[Later, SHERLOCK and JOAN discuss MORIARTY's current motives.]


SHERLOCK: The woman [MORIARTY] is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma I've had sex with. I would be lying if I said I was the strongest assessor of her motives at this point.


...


[JOAN talks to SHERLOCK about his correspondence with MORIARTY.]


JOAN: Irene was the love of your life. That is why, in spite of everything, you can't quite give her up. I get that. But I also know that you're only gonna get hurt in the long run because there is no Irene. There is only Moriarty. And Moriarty is never gonna change. (*ouch*)


2x16 ""One Percent Solution""


[SHERLOCK and JOAN have taken in roosters in their brownstone, for the purposes of SHERLOCK's scientific experiment. He left one of them in front of JOAN's room one morning, causing her to wake up early.]


JOAN (carrying a caged rouster): Why is Romulus outside my door?

SHERLOCK: That's Remus.

JOAN: I don't care which cock I'm holding, I just want to know how it got there...! 

(Awkward pause.) 

Okay, congratulations, you got me to say it.

SHERLOCK: I don't know if you've settled on an epitaph yet, but it does occur to me that that would look fantastic on a tombstone.


2x17 ""Ears to You""


JOAN: Well, I just thought you'd be neck-deep in files from the Sarah Cushing case.

SHERLOCK: I was for most of the evening. Then the captain called and told me that the severed ears Gordon Cushing received were a DNA match for Sarah's.

JOAN (shocked): You're kidding.

SHERLOCK (every word dripping with sarcasm): That's me, Watson. Joke machine.


2x24 ""Grand Experiment""


[JOAN has been planing to move out of the brownstone. SHERLOCK tried to convince her to stay. This is her response.]


JOAN: You have this kind of... pull. Like gravity. I'm so lucky that I fell into your orbit. But if we live together, that's how it will always be. Me orbiting you. There'll always be the next case, the next problem. And I will always get pulled along. It's an exciting way to live, but there are consequences. We will work this out. I know we will. But I need to get my own place.


3x1 ""Enough Nemesis To Go Around""


[Following her and SHERLOCK's return from London, KITTY has been been following JOAN around, but JOAN eventually found out and confronted her.]


KITTY: Can you blame me for being just a little bit curious?

SHERLOCK: Yes, I can.

KITTY: She's the original model. The one you never shut up about. You didn't think I'd want to see what she's got that I don't?

SHERLOCK: What she has is two years of training. Two years of doing exactly what I said. I told you before we left London, I have plans here for both of us. Do you remember our plans?

KITTY: I'm sorry, okay?

SHERLOCK: Don't be sorry.  Be better. (*ouch*)


(His gaze lands upon bunch of papers on the table.)


Earlier I had you organize these writing samples in decreasing order of the authors' potential sexual deviancy. (LOL)


(SHERLOCK literally scatters all the papers KITTY had organized all over the floor.)


Do it again.


(Walks away.)


3x13 ""Hemlock""


SHERLOCK: I'm an expert in many things, but love is not one of them. I do know, however, it cannot be reduced to a checklist of traits.


3x16 ""For All You Know""


[SHERLOCK is suspected of murdering a woman he doesn't even remember meeting, because he was using drugs heavily at the time. He doesn't take it too well. He even resorts to staring at the old, blurry photograph of himself, taken years ago in a drug-induced haze.]


JOAN: If you really want to beat yourself up-

SHERLOCK: You think this is an exercise in self-pity.

JOAN: I think this is an Olympics in self-pity! First you tell Prentice Gutierrez he can break your hand.
Now you're sitting in the dark staring at an old photograph. You did not kill that woman. Stop acting like you did.

SHERLOCK: You are positive I didn't do it.

JOAN: Of course I am.

SHERLOCK: How? 

JOAN: Because I know you.

SHERLOCK: Yes. Better than anyone. But let me make one thing perfectly clear. 

(Points at the photograph.)

You did not know him! You never met him.

JOAN: So you're Dr. Jekyll now and he's Mr. Hyde? 

SHERLOCK: You continue to misunderstand. At that point in my life, I did not plumb down into some dark part of myself. I detached from myself, from all that was essential to me. To say that you can guess what I was capable of is illogical. I was a different person. And the fact that I remember so little from that time has been nothing but a tremendous relief to me until now! 


[Short, tense silence.]


JOAN: I'm sorry, okay? I know it hurts, but there is nothing you can say that's gonna convince me that you killed that woman.


...


[Soon afterward, SHERLOCK and JOAN go to interrogate OSCAR, SHERLOCK's former drug dealer. When OSCAR refuses to let them in, SHERLOCK literally breaks in and drags him off the couch.]


OSCAR: Ah, man, you busted my door!

SHERLOCK: That might be the highlight of this encounter, Oscar.


4x1 ""The Past Is Parent""


SHERLOCK (about working on the 1927 murder case): Justice is like an orgasm. It can never come too late.


4x7 ""Miss Taken""


SHERLOCK: To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren't in AFIS.

CASSIE: Of course they aren't. I've never committed any crimes.

SHERLOCK: You've never been caught.

CASSIE: Is there a difference?

SHERLOCK: So how old are you? Really?

CASSIE: Fifteen.

(She pauses, smirking.)

No, wait.

(Short silence.) 

Twenty-five.

(Even more smug now.)

Or maybe it's some other number.

SHERLOCK: My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport. She says she's never seen you before. You're also a stranger to Norman Ott. He was taken into custody yesterday.

CASSIE: Who?

SHERLOCK: He wasn't lying when he said he never met you before. I could tell. Would you at least concede you spent some time in Sturbridge? How else would you know about Mina's situation?

CASSIE: I've been to lots of places.

SHERLOCK: Have you enjoyed them? 'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.

CASSIE: You think I killed that FBI agent, but... you don't have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car. I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.

SHERLOCK: Tell me one.

CASSIE (sighs): Um...


[No answer. SHERLOCK smirks in return.]


CASSIE: I hope you come to my trial. Should be fun.

SHERLOCK: Think you can lie your way out?

CASSIE: I do.

(Short silence. They lock eyes.)

Now tell me... am I lying?


4x13 ""A Study In Charlotte""


SHERLOCK (talking about their neighbor): That's the way of the world, Watson. We were an irresistible force, he was a movable object. He moved. If you want to feel bad about something, feel bad about the fact that we're no closer to identifying Charlotte's killer than we were five hours ago.


4x17 ""You've Got Me, Who's Got You?""


[SHERLOCK is confronted by a superhero wannabe-whose name is later revealed to be BEN-who demands to keep his identity hidden, which includes wearing a mask while talking to SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK reveals that he has already deduced quite a lot about him,  such as what he does for a living and where he ""patrols"", prompting BEN to give up and take his mask off.]


BEN (baffled): How'd you do all that?

SHERLOCK: I was bitten by a radioactive detective.


4x24 ""Difference In Kind""


MORLAND HOLMES: Being loved by you is a dangerous thing, Sherlock. Probably why I'm still alive.


5x13 ""Over A Barrel""


[JOAN has been taken hostage by JACK BRUNELLE, who demands SHERLOCK to solve a brutal attack on his son before the statute of limitations runs out. JOAN tries to reason with JACK, but he shuts her down quickly, explaining... ]


JACK BRUNELLE: Do you have any idea what it's like to lose a child? If you ask any parent if they would die in place of a daughter or a son, I guarantee you the answer would be yes. And do you know why? It's not because of honor, or duty, or parental responsibility. It's because it's easier. It's easier to die than it is to be left behind. Every morning since Connor passed away, I wake up and I wish it was me instead of him.


6x9 ""Nobody Lives Forever""


[SHERLOCK and JOAN talk about MYCROFT never contacting SHERLOCK since he (MYCROFT) had gone into hiding, even once the criminal organization that wanted him dead has been wiped out by the rival cartel.]


SHERLOCK (to JOAN): You're taking his [MYCROFT's] side, understandably. Perhaps if I'd have given you three and a half orgasms, you'd see things my way.


Your picks? And thoughts?

&lt;p&gt;JAMIE MORIARTY (after revealing her true self to SHERLOCK): You look at people and you see puzzles. I see games. You? You&amp;#39;re the game I&amp;#39;ll win everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never kill you. Not in a million years. You may not be as unique as you thought, darling, but you&amp;#39;re still a work of art. I appreciate art.
What I can do, what I will do, is hurt you. Worse than I did before.
I have reserves of creativity I haven&amp;#39;t even begun to tap. So please, for you own good, let me win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x2 &amp;quot;Solve for X&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: I&amp;#39;m an expert on poisons, Watson. I know virtually everything there is to know about them. But I&amp;#39;ve come to learn over the last few years that there is nothing on this planet quite so toxic as guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x3 &amp;quot;We Are Everyone&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Do you think we&amp;#39;re cut off from the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(SHERLOCK just stares back at her, frowning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, neither of us dates, neither of us really goes out much. At all, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: We&amp;#39;re not cut off from the world. We&amp;#39;re engaged in creating one that&amp;#39;s actually worth living in. One that addresses our needs entirely, and eliminates everything extraneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x6 &amp;quot;An Unnatural Arrangement&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Quite frankly, I&amp;#39;m surprised it&amp;#39;s taken this long for the captain&amp;#39;s marriage to buckle. He&amp;#39;s an excellent detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: What does that have to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Well, as you know, detection is a calling, not a job. Hardly leaves one with time left over to sustain the elaborate ruse of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Because, of course, you think marriage is an elaborate ruse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: There are other ways to describe it. An unnatural arrangement which forces its participants into an unhealthy monogamy. An accretion of petty fights and resentful compromises which, like Chinese water torture, slowly transforms both parties into howling, neurotic versions of their former selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x12 &amp;quot;Diabolical Kind&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK&amp;#39;s letter to MORIARTY, featured at the beginning of the episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: &amp;quot;We have spilled much ink, you and I, in our discussion of human connection, and we&amp;#39;re no closer to understanding than we were when the correspondence began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often feel as if I&amp;#39;m standing on one side of a wide chasm, shouting across, and wondering if the response I hear comes from you, or if it is my own voice echoing back to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, on my side of the canyon, that the search for unity with another is the source of the world&amp;#39;s unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watch as Watson, eager as ever to extract some meaning from the prevailing social conventions, endures a series of curated mating rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that she&amp;#39;s incrementally less content each time she returns from one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conduct myself as though I&amp;#39;m above matters of the heart, chiefly because I have seen them corrode people I respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my candid moments, I sometimes wonder if I take the stance I do because love, for lack of a better word, is a game I fail to understand, and so I opt not to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if I truly had the purity of all my convictions, I wouldn&amp;#39;t regret so many of the things I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would I persist, against so many of my better instincts, in this correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find you a challenge, one that, in spite of all that you&amp;#39;ve done, continues to stimulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the conversation, futile though it may finally be, continues, and we are left to wonder: have we simply failed to find the answers to the questions that preoccupy us, or can they not be answered at all? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for both of us, the world always presents the next diversion, the next elaborate distraction from the problems that vex.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Later, SHERLOCK and JOAN discuss MORIARTY&amp;#39;s current motives.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: The woman [MORIARTY] is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma I&amp;#39;ve had sex with. I would be lying if I said I was the strongest assessor of her motives at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[JOAN talks to SHERLOCK about his correspondence with MORIARTY.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Irene was the love of your life. That is why, in spite of everything, you can&amp;#39;t quite give her up. I get that. But I also know that you&amp;#39;re only gonna get hurt in the long run because there is no Irene. There is only Moriarty. And Moriarty is never gonna change. (&lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x16 &amp;quot;One Percent Solution&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SHERLOCK and JOAN have taken in roosters in their brownstone, for the purposes of SHERLOCK&amp;#39;s scientific experiment. He left one of them in front of JOAN&amp;#39;s room one morning, causing her to wake up early.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN (carrying a caged rouster): Why is Romulus outside my door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: That&amp;#39;s Remus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: I don&amp;#39;t care which cock I&amp;#39;m holding, I just want to know how it got there...! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Awkward pause.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, congratulations, you got me to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve settled on an epitaph yet, but it does occur to me that that would look fantastic on a tombstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x17 &amp;quot;Ears to You&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Well, I just thought you&amp;#39;d be neck-deep in files from the Sarah Cushing case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: I was for most of the evening. Then the captain called and told me that the severed ears Gordon Cushing received were a DNA match for Sarah&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN (shocked): You&amp;#39;re kidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK (every word dripping with sarcasm): That&amp;#39;s me, Watson. Joke machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x24 &amp;quot;Grand Experiment&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[JOAN has been planing to move out of the brownstone. SHERLOCK tried to convince her to stay. This is her response.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: You have this kind of... pull. Like gravity. I&amp;#39;m so lucky that I fell into your orbit. But if we live together, that&amp;#39;s how it will always be. Me orbiting you. There&amp;#39;ll always be the next case, the next problem. And I will always get pulled along. It&amp;#39;s an exciting way to live, but there are consequences. We will work this out. I know we will. But I need to get my own place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x1 &amp;quot;Enough Nemesis To Go Around&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Following her and SHERLOCK&amp;#39;s return from London, KITTY has been been following JOAN around, but JOAN eventually found out and confronted her.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KITTY: Can you blame me for being just a little bit curious?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Yes, I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KITTY: She&amp;#39;s the original model. The one you never shut up about. You didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d want to see what she&amp;#39;s got that I don&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: What she has is two years of training. Two years of doing exactly what I said. I told you before we left London, I have plans here for both of us. Do you remember our plans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KITTY: I&amp;#39;m sorry, okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Don&amp;#39;t be sorry.  Be better. (&lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(His gaze lands upon bunch of papers on the table.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier I had you organize these writing samples in decreasing order of the authors&amp;#39; potential sexual deviancy. (LOL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(SHERLOCK literally scatters all the papers KITTY had organized all over the floor.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Walks away.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x13 &amp;quot;Hemlock&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: I&amp;#39;m an expert in many things, but love is not one of them. I do know, however, it cannot be reduced to a checklist of traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x16 &amp;quot;For All You Know&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SHERLOCK is suspected of murdering a woman he doesn&amp;#39;t even remember meeting, because he was using drugs heavily at the time. He doesn&amp;#39;t take it too well. He even resorts to staring at the old, blurry photograph of himself, taken years ago in a drug-induced haze.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: If you really want to beat yourself up-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: You think this is an exercise in self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: I think this is an Olympics in self-pity! First you tell Prentice Gutierrez he can break your hand.
Now you&amp;#39;re sitting in the dark staring at an old photograph. You did not kill that woman. Stop acting like you did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: You are positive I didn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Of course I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: How? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: Because I know you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Yes. Better than anyone. But let me make one thing perfectly clear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Points at the photograph.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did not know him! You never met him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: So you&amp;#39;re Dr. Jekyll now and he&amp;#39;s Mr. Hyde? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: You continue to misunderstand. At that point in my life, I did not plumb down into some dark part of myself. I detached from myself, from all that was essential to me. To say that you can guess what I was capable of is illogical. I was a different person. And the fact that I remember so little from that time has been nothing but a tremendous relief to me until now! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Short, tense silence.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOAN: I&amp;#39;m sorry, okay? I know it hurts, but there is nothing you can say that&amp;#39;s gonna convince me that you killed that woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Soon afterward, SHERLOCK and JOAN go to interrogate OSCAR, SHERLOCK&amp;#39;s former drug dealer. When OSCAR refuses to let them in, SHERLOCK literally breaks in and drags him off the couch.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSCAR: Ah, man, you busted my door!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: That might be the highlight of this encounter, Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x1 &amp;quot;The Past Is Parent&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK (about working on the 1927 murder case): Justice is like an orgasm. It can never come too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x7 &amp;quot;Miss Taken&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren&amp;#39;t in AFIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: Of course they aren&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve never committed any crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: You&amp;#39;ve never been caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: Is there a difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: So how old are you? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: Fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(She pauses, smirking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Short silence.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Even more smug now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it&amp;#39;s some other number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport. She says she&amp;#39;s never seen you before. You&amp;#39;re also a stranger to Norman Ott. He was taken into custody yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: Who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: He wasn&amp;#39;t lying when he said he never met you before. I could tell. Would you at least concede you spent some time in Sturbridge? How else would you know about Mina&amp;#39;s situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: I&amp;#39;ve been to lots of places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Have you enjoyed them? &amp;#39;Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: You think I killed that FBI agent, but... you don&amp;#39;t have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car. I&amp;#39;ve already come up with six different ways to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Tell me one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE (sighs): Um...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[No answer. SHERLOCK smirks in return.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: I hope you come to my trial. Should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: Think you can lie your way out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASSIE: I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Short silence. They lock eyes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now tell me... am I lying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x13 &amp;quot;A Study In Charlotte&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK (talking about their neighbor): That&amp;#39;s the way of the world, Watson. We were an irresistible force, he was a movable object. He moved. If you want to feel bad about something, feel bad about the fact that we&amp;#39;re no closer to identifying Charlotte&amp;#39;s killer than we were five hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x17 &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve Got Me, Who&amp;#39;s Got You?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SHERLOCK is confronted by a superhero wannabe-whose name is later revealed to be BEN-who demands to keep his identity hidden, which includes wearing a mask while talking to SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK reveals that he has already deduced quite a lot about him,  such as what he does for a living and where he &amp;quot;patrols&amp;quot;, prompting BEN to give up and take his mask off.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEN (baffled): How&amp;#39;d you do all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK: I was bitten by a radioactive detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x24 &amp;quot;Difference In Kind&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MORLAND HOLMES: Being loved by you is a dangerous thing, Sherlock. Probably why I&amp;#39;m still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x13 &amp;quot;Over A Barrel&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[JOAN has been taken hostage by JACK BRUNELLE, who demands SHERLOCK to solve a brutal attack on his son before the statute of limitations runs out. JOAN tries to reason with JACK, but he shuts her down quickly, explaining... ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JACK BRUNELLE: Do you have any idea what it&amp;#39;s like to lose a child? If you ask any parent if they would die in place of a daughter or a son, I guarantee you the answer would be yes. And do you know why? It&amp;#39;s not because of honor, or duty, or parental responsibility. It&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s easier. It&amp;#39;s easier to die than it is to be left behind. Every morning since Connor passed away, I wake up and I wish it was me instead of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6x9 &amp;quot;Nobody Lives Forever&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SHERLOCK and JOAN talk about MYCROFT never contacting SHERLOCK since he (MYCROFT) had gone into hiding, even once the criminal organization that wanted him dead has been wiped out by the rival cartel.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK (to JOAN): You&amp;#39;re taking his [MYCROFT&amp;#39;s] side, understandably. Perhaps if I&amp;#39;d have given you three and a half orgasms, you&amp;#39;d see things my way.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes the dialogue is just so understated, brilliant and hilarious. In S4E22, 15:12-15:28m:

   Sherlock: If someone is say... a cannibal serial killer, that’s not enough to call them crazy. As long as you know that eating and killing your victims is wrong, you’re considered sane in the eyes of the law. 
   ADA: [shrug] That’s what the law says. 
   Joan: In the work that Dr. Naylor did for you, did the name Morland Holmes ever come up?
   ADA: Holmes? Related to you? [looking at Sherlock]
   Sherlock: That’s what the law says. [looking chagrined and emphasizing “law”]

🤩 I could watch that a quizillion times. Also I love Morland. He looked so unabashedly happy when Capn Gregson visited him, I feel sad for him when it becomes clear that Morland is a suspect. 

Also, Aiden Quinn is seriously great. I don’t think there’s ever a false note with him. Jon Michael Hall is also flawless. 

Miller and Liu are generally great though their roles are more complex, being part myth part human, extraordinary and approachable, exciting and well-worn. I like Joan the most when she’s seriously grossed out, eg Sherlock’s Dante examples. 

Back to season 5: Sherlock’s certifiable obsession with Shinwell, esp reasons to deride, demean and demonize him... his insistence on applying false equivalencies “i tried. Shinwell didn’t.” “Tyson is smart. Shinwell [now dead] was an idiot.” Taking into account none of the realities of life for people like Shinwell versus poor little rich boys... is too timely and lacking in introspection or comment. Yes, the characters comment on things all the time, including social and moral issues; they’re the viewers’ avatars. 

Even though i fast forward through all shinwell scenes especially when sherlock and joan talk about him, I’m still revolted by a sick sherlock crying because he’s afraid he won’t be able to “hold onto his sobriety” if he can’t be a detective. Wahhhhhhhh. 

Newsflash. Loser shinwell “maintained his sobriety “ while working undervover to take down his gang. That’s dedication. Yeah i know joan gave lip service to that once shinwell was dead. It’s the sort of showing “too little too late” was meant for. 

I’m likely setting off some twee “abrasiveness” alarms. Also coded as 0011-a Personal, 0024-h Issues, 0198-p We Don’t Talk About the Impact of Class/Race Inequality Here, or 13788-ttf TOO CLOSE TOO CLOSE!!!!

,elementary,"How factual is the show’s explanation of “P vs NP”? 

This is how it’s explained in the show:

“In simplest terms, P versus NP asks if every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. Sounds innocent enough, right? Only it's not. It is filthy. Some experts have even theorized that it can't be solved.” 

Later on they elaborate on the real-world application to the solution of this problem:

“I mean, mathematicians are drawn to P versus NP because it's math's great white whale, but the truth is... a solution would have massive real world implications.... A correct proof would essentially render all modern encryption obsolete. With the right software, you could hack into any system in the world. They won't be able to stop you.”

Then they explain “why” this is possible:

“Encryption consists of setting up problems so complicated that a computer can't solve them. Solving P versus NP lets you run through the possible answer fast enough to crack the code. I mean, you could come and go as you please through any server on the planet. It's a skeleton key. It's the key to building the skeleton key. I mean, once you had the solution, you'd still need to write the code to apply it. The digital world would be your oyster.”

Confession time.  I plotted out a *Supergirl*/*Elementary* crossover.  Morland Holmes was kidnapped while on business in National City, so Sherlock and Joan fly to National City and before too long cross paths with Supergirl, and they team up to take down Intergang and get Morland back.  And, of course, Sherlock looks at Kara Danvers, has a puzzled look, says, ""Of course,"" and winks at Kara, because he knows her secret, but he won't say anything.

I also thought a *Blue Bloods* crossover would work, since it's a cop show set in New York.

Sherlock and Joan in Hawaii for *Hawaii Five-O* would be fun.

,elementary,"I first wanted to make ""Best Elementary episodes"" thread, but I am kind of busy at the moment, and it would take quite some time to list all my favorite ""Elementary"" episodes and explain what I like about them, so I decided to give this a try. I will definitely post ""Best episodes"" thread eventually. But until then...


Personally, there aren't many ""Elementary"" episodes that I outright hate; the ones that I would consider the worst. Even the weaker ones are often pretty enjoyable. But there are just some episodes where nothing seems to work, so to say, and there are little to no redeeming qualities about them. Here are two examples that I can think off:


2x21 ""The Man with the Twisted Lip""


This episode was so contrived and uninspired. First of all, Sherlock and Joan didn't really use any deduction skills to solve the case of the week. They just made some basic effort that the police didn't bother with, because the victim was a recovering addict. 


Sherlock finds out (via Joan) that a recovering addict who attends the same sobriety meetings as he, a woman named Tess, is upset. Her sister, Paige (also a recovering addict), went missing a few days ago, and the authorities aren't taking it seriously. They think that Paige simply relapsed and took off, and that she will return eventually. Sherlock promises to look into the case; partially because, as he says, Tess helped him during his first sobriety meetings (even though she never appeared on the show before).


So, Sherlock and Joan go to Paige's apartment, searched it... and find her drug stash in her closet, within two minutes. Together with sort of a ""business card"", with the drug dealer's phone number on it. Then they call the dealer, placed an ""order"", and follow him back to his hideout. Then they call the police to arrest the drug dealer and his accomplices. Genius.


Looking into the drug connection leads nowhere. All the suspects deny any involvement, and most of them have alibies. Sherlock and Joan have to look elsewhere for suspects and leads. It turns out that Paige was an aspiring musician. Sherlock listens to her songs, and notices that she mentions a particular spot in the local park often (Harriet Tubman plaque). So he and Joan go to that location. They find the victim's guitar just lying there. Then they notice shoe prints, leading further into the park. They follow them, leading to the discovery of two bodies: Paige, and the man named Zack Pillar, both of them shot to death with a shotgun. They soon conclude that the man was the main target, and Paige was a collateral victim. Sherlock notices something odd: there are shotgun pellets all along the rocks surrounding Zack Pillar's body, meaning that the killer missed the victim [Zack] several times, even though he was clearly cornered. Sherlock also notices a mosquito flying around, though Marcus points out that it is still too early for mosquitos.


All that raises another important question: how long were the bodies lying there? As far as I remember, they never mentioned the approximate time of death. But between the time Paige went missing (according to her sister's statement), and the point when Sherlock and Joan found the bodies, it stands the reason that the victims had been shot to death at least three days ago. So, two dead bodies were just lying in a public park for three or more days, without anyone finding them and calling 911? And nobody reported Zack Pillar missing?


Or was it all a coincidence? Did Paige happen to go missing due to some other reason, and she and Zack Pillar happened to get killed shortly before Sherlock and Joan went to search that area of the park? Because that might be even more contrived.


It turns out that the main target, Zack Pillar, worked with drones, and he recently moved to New York from Las Vegas. His current boss says that Zack used to fly drones for military contractor.


Eventually, Sherlock and Joan start suspecting that, while on a mission in Afghanistan, Zack Pillar (still employed by the Las Vegas company at the time) accidentally killed thirteen CIA agents (that he mistook for terrorists) with the drone, and the company made him keep quiet about it, to avoid scandal and lawsuits. After Zack switched jobs and moved to New York, his former employers kept surveiling him. They figured out that Zack was still struggling with guilt, and that he was planning to come clean, so they killed him. In fact, they shot him to death using a drone; which explains why the shooter missed several times, despite having Zack cornered.


What makes Sherlock and Joan so sure of this theory? The victim [Zack Pillar] kept news clippings about the Afghanistan incident in his apartment, and actually wrote things like ""Was it my fault?"" and ""I have to say something"" under the articles. Yup. Real mystery there.


Also, Sherlock notes that the victim's laptop is missing. Apparently, after murdering Zack Pillar, the perpetrator(s) gained access to his apartment and took his laptop, in order to remove any evidence of their motive. Except for the news clippings about that particular incident, with notes that might as well be the victim's testimony. Apparently, they missed that. 


Oh, and also, during all of this, a robot-mosquito, programmed by the murderers, is following Sherlock and Joan around. The same device is also used to poison the victim's therapist, after the authorities manage to get him to cooperate. Sure, why not.


Finally, Sherlock arranges a meeting with the victim's former employer/killer, while Joan literally goes into his company, distracts the security, breaks into the suspect's office, then into his safe deposit box, and finds the file containing the victim's original statement, confirming their theory. After being confronted with the evidence, the C.O.O. is arrested. He confesses and cuts the deal with the DA.


How? Why? First of all, Sherlock and Joan obtained the incriminating evidence illegally. Sure, it wasn't the first time they had done that. Episode 2x10 ""Tremors"" already addressed that. But at least in other cases, they would always have some possible deniability, such as claiming that the door happened to be wide opened or something. In this episode, Joan literally broke into the suspect's office, and then into his safe deposit box. And they are probably security cameras all over that place too. Second of all, that file proves that the company made a mistake and that there was a cover up, but it doesn't prove that the company had killed Zack Pillar over it. And lastly, why on Earth would the C.O.O. keep the copy of the victim's incriminating testimony in the first place? Why not just burn it or something?


Also, I personally hated Joan/Mycroft relationship, so this episode left an additional bitter taste in my mouth. I have no energy to criticize the subplot... let's just say I really didn't like it either.


The fact that case of the week was very similar to the ""Mentalist"" episode (that aired a year prior) certainly didn't help.


https://imdb.com/title/tt3073034/?ref_=fn_al_tt_0


Also, the episode was titled ""The Man With the Twisted Lip"", but it had little to no similarities to the original ACD story of the same name. Sure, both the original story and that ""Elementary"" episode started with Sherlock and Watson searching for a missing drug addict... but that is also where pretty much all similarities end.


5x8 ""How the Sausage Is Made""


The case of the week was so contrived. So, after committing the murder, the perpetrator cut up the victim's body and turned him into sausages? He didn't even do that parthimself-he just left the flesh in the butcher shop, and let the employees do that for him. There are much easier ways to dispose of the body. Not to mention, the method that the murderer chose was incredibly risky. What if the butcher shop owner called the police after noticing that his shop had been broken into? What if somebody noticed that there was something... off with some of the meat? And what did the murderer do with the victim's bones, and internal organs, and other stuff that wasn't used to make the sausage?


Which raises even more questions: how come the owner, or any of his employees, didn't notice that they suddenly had at least 120 or so pounds of extra meat? Or that that meat wasn't beef or pork? And why didn't the owner call the police after noticing that his butcher shop had been broken into? He claimed he saw no point contacting the police, because nothing was stolen. But what if somebody had tampered with his meat? Sure, it sounds far-fetched, but that possibility never even crossed his mind? That episode made no sense.

But at least in other cases, they would always have some possible deniability, such as claiming that the door happened to be wide opened or something. In this episode, Joan literally broke into the suspect&amp;#39;s office, and then into his safe deposit box. And they are probably security cameras all over that place too. Second of all, that file proves that the company made a mistake and that there was a cover up, but it doesn&amp;#39;t prove that the company had killed Zack Pillar over it. And lastly, why on Earth would the C.O.O. keep the copy of the victim&amp;#39;s incriminating testimony in the first place? Why not just burn it or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I personally hated Joan/Mycroft relationship, so this episode left an additional bitter taste in my mouth. I have no energy to criticize the subplot... let&amp;#39;s just say I really didn&amp;#39;t like it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that case of the week was very similar to the &amp;quot;Mentalist&amp;quot; episode (that aired a year prior) certainly didn&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imdb.com/title/tt3073034/?ref_=fn_al_tt_0""&gt;https://imdb.com/title/tt3073034/?ref_=fn_al_tt_0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the episode was titled &amp;quot;The Man With the Twisted Lip&amp;quot;, but it had little to no similarities to the original ACD story of the same name. Sure, both the original story and that &amp;quot;Elementary&amp;quot; episode started with Sherlock and Watson searching for a missing drug addict... but that is also where pretty much all similarities end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x8 &amp;quot;How the Sausage Is Made&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of the week was so contrived. So, after committing the murder, the perpetrator cut up the victim&amp;#39;s body and turned him into sausages? He didn&amp;#39;t even do that parthimself-he just left the flesh in the butcher shop, and let the employees do that for him. There are much easier ways to dispose of the body. Not to mention, the method that the murderer chose was incredibly risky. What if the butcher shop owner called the police after noticing that his shop had been broken into? What if somebody noticed that there was something... off with some of the meat? And what did the murderer do with the victim&amp;#39;s bones, and internal organs, and other stuff that wasn&amp;#39;t used to make the sausage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which raises even more questions: how come the owner, or any of his employees, didn&amp;#39;t notice that they suddenly had at least 120 or so pounds of extra meat? Or that that meat wasn&amp;#39;t beef or pork? And why didn&amp;#39;t the owner call the police after noticing that his butcher shop had been broken into? He claimed he saw no point contacting the police, because nothing was stolen. But what if somebody had tampered with his meat? Sure, it sounds far-fetched, but that possibility never even crossed his mind? That episode made no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you agree or disagree with my examples? What are, in your opinion, the worst &amp;quot;Elementary&amp;quot; episodes, and why?&lt;/p&gt;

- somebody's been spying on women and taking pictures of them (cf. promo photos). Michael's lair or staged darkroom?

Watson has worked two sexual kidnappings with female victims: Kitty and Preeda Boonark in Be My Guest. In both cases, the victim was traumatized by her experience. 

Watson has also been held captive twice, once by Le Milieu and once by Jack Brunelle. (I didn't say kidnapped because I think that requires moving the victim and in Over a Barrel she stayed put.) Both of those cases were ransom-type situations, with the captor persuading a third party to do or provide something.

However, both kidnappings from this season were of an entirely different type, one that didn't even seem to be on Watson's radar: the kidnapper wanted to force the victim herself to do something. The victims were at extreme risk of being killed, but seemed ok once released. The captors were male, but that was irrelevant to the crime itself. 

Given these situations, I wonder if Watson has some unresolved PTSD from her two experiences being held captive. She tells herself: ""What happened to me wasn't so bad; at least I was never raped,"" but this very rationalization gives her a blind spot where kidnappings are concerned.

That's due to the fact that the suspect in this case, also appears in another TV series.

Sherlock Holmes (S6E11): She (Moriarty) hasn't written to me in **close to a year.**

If this were the real world, there would be nothing to conclude from this since it'd likely be nothing more than a coincidence. However, it's not the real world, it's a story.

,elementary,"For some reason, this ""detail"" rarely gets discussed, but there is really nothing ambiguous about it. Sebastian Moran, ""M"", was killing people under Moriarty's orders. In 1x12 ""M"", Sherlock mentions that M's youngest victim was twelve years old. Meaning that Moriarty, at least once, hired her henchman to string up a twelve year old upside-down on a tripod, slash his/her throat and let him/her bleed to death, then dump the body in the ocean.

,elementary,"Until recently, all the Moriarty paintings we had seen were forgeries (imitations of the Old Masters) and landscapes / urban skylines. The sole exception had been Joan's portrait and even that had a ""forgery"" flair to it, given it was executed very much in the style of Rembrandt. Now, all those works were painted while Moriarty was either pretending to be Irene or in custody which, to me, implies those works were ""noncommital"" and fairly impersonal: after all, she wasn't going to reveal anything of her true self to her investigators / captors. Hence, for example, the absence of any painting or representation of Sherlock or her daughter.

Then S6E11 came along and we saw a new Moriarty painting in the coffee shop...and it was unlike anything we'd seen before. It was two women, one sitting on a chair looking quite forlorn and another lying on the ground (dead?) with a red flower in her hands. The fact that it's such a completely original work gives me pause. The show's prop department could have painted another skyline and it wouldn't have changed anything to Sherlock's deduction: he recognized Moriarty's authorship thanks to her brush strokes, not the painting's subject matter. Why did the people in charge of creating Moriarty's art bother coming up with something as ""soulful"", evocative and a touch sinister? 

It could be nothing, of course. Just the show's art department having a particularly creative day. But it intrigues me.

Now, all those works were painted while Moriarty was either pretending to be Irene or in custody which, to me, implies those works were &amp;quot;noncommital&amp;quot; and fairly impersonal: after all, she wasn&amp;#39;t going to reveal anything of her true self to her investigators / captors. Hence, for example, the absence of any painting or representation of Sherlock or her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then S6E11 came along and we saw a new Moriarty painting in the coffee shop...and it was unlike anything we&amp;#39;d seen before. It was two women, one sitting on a chair looking quite forlorn and another lying on the ground (dead?) with a red flower in her hands. The fact that it&amp;#39;s such a completely original work gives me pause. The show&amp;#39;s prop department could have painted another skyline and it wouldn&amp;#39;t have changed anything to Sherlock&amp;#39;s deduction: he recognized Moriarty&amp;#39;s authorship thanks to her brush strokes, not the painting&amp;#39;s subject matter. Why did the people in charge of creating Moriarty&amp;#39;s art bother coming up with something as &amp;quot;soulful&amp;quot;, evocative and a touch sinister? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be nothing, of course. Just the show&amp;#39;s art department having a particularly creative day. But it intrigues me. Two female figures who could be two different women or could be one and the same (a woman with two faces would fit Moriarty&amp;#39;s narrative). One of them&amp;#39;s seemingly dead... &lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"I posted this on the recent episode thread, but I think that it might warrant its own thread. This is just my opinion, of course.


First of all, babies have no identity, no personalities and no interests, because they are, well, babies. They equal to basic human needs and several moments that might or might not be cute. (Yes, raising your child is usually a wonderful thing, but it doesn't translate well to film/television, and a 40+ minute procedural could hardly capture it even if it did). Viewers can hardly relate to TV babies, nor really care about them, at least not in a long run. For the same reason, pretty much all the plots that can derived from baby storylines are more or less the same, and have already been done dozens of times. Staying up late in order to take care of the baby, trying to teach the baby to talk and walk, etc. Seen it before, way too many times. At best it would be cute for a few episodes, but then the baby would become a character that does nothing but detract the protagonists from the main plot. Both Sherlock and Joan are intelligent, complex, witty characters, and for a new recurring character to work, he/she would have to be able to interact with them on a similar level, and challenge them in an interesting, original way. That is why Moriarty, Kitty and Morland worked, and Mycroft and Shinwell, well, didn't. [Though I kind of liked Mycroft's interactions with Sherlock; his relationship with Joan was just bad.] Now just imagine adding a baby to the mix, and wasting a plot on that.


No, Sherlock will not be teaching the baby to pick locks and solve crimes, like one of the posters suggested. For that to work, the ""baby"" would realistically have to be at least three or four years old. Yes, I know that it was likely just a joke/hyperbole, but I'm just pointing to a lack of any interesting plot that could be derived from a baby storyline. 


As for Sherlock and Joan raising a child together, I have never heard of man/woman friends who live together and work together for years, and raise a child together, all completely platonic. That is ridiculous and it just doesn't work like that in real life. That is coming from a man who does have plenty of female friends and knows several men and women who really are just friends. Yes, I know that ""Elementary"" is not a real life, but one would have to bend almost all the logic backwards to make this seem remotely believable. No, I don't want the writers/producers to make Sherlock and Joan a couple, but bringing a baby into the show is just ridiculous. Plus, there is no way that anyone else would agree to date Joan after finding out that she lives and works with her male friend, who is also helping her raise her (adopted) child. The same with Sherlock ever having a serious relationship again. Which would be fine, if neither of them wanted something like that, but the writers have also gone out of their way to show that both Sherlock and Joan desire a serious romantic relationship and love, at least on some level (Joan dating Mycroft and then Andrew, as well as going to the dates arranged on that ""TrueRomantix"" site; Sherlock dating Fiona and possibly still having feelings for Moriarty, on some level). 


When would Sherlock and Joan find the time to raise a baby, either together or ""merely"" with assistance from the other? Yes, they do not follow most of the rules that the cops do, including the daily working hours/shifts (because they are not cops), but they still work on dozens of complicated cases every year, as well as taking private clients. Not to mention a bunch of crazy stuff Sherlock keeps around the brownstone, either relating to the cases or simply out of curiosity/for research purposes (including toxins, weapons, etc.) 


Last but not least, can anyone name a single TV show where a baby storyline improved its quality; or, at least, didn't decrease it? Even in sitcoms, that are often light-hearted and family oriented by default (not all of them, evidently, just using that as an example), such storylines are usually a clear ""jumping the shark"" moment, and are often poorly received. You probably can't, and there is a reason for that. The closest I can think of is Danny and Lindsay having a baby in ""CSI: New York"". But Danny and Lindsay were not the main characters, and the baby was not heavily featured, other than in just a few episodes.

,elementary,"I'm trying to think back over all the interactions we have seen between Michael and anyone else.

At the end of last season, one of Sherlock's symptoms of his Post Concussive Syndrome was that he was imagining conversations with his dead mother.  So, we know that hallucinations (people and fire) are part of his symptoms.

Every interaction we see with Michael, where he is talking about being a serial killer, or where he is being ""interviewed"" about the matter, is with Sherlock.   Sherlock speaks to Michael alone at the meetings, Sherlock speaks to Michael alone when he pays a visit to Sherlock's house, Sherlock speaks to him alone when he visits him at Michael's house, Sherlock is the only one we see speak to Michael on the phone, Sherlock speaks to Michael alone outside Michael's apartment during the stakeout, and alone again at the hospital.  As far as I can remember (with one exception) the only live person we've seen interact with Michael is Sherlock. 

He's never been approached by the police, or asked in for questioning by Bell or Gregson.   Watson has never been around during an interaction with Sherlock, as far as I can remember.   Joan doesn't see Michael during their stakeout, and the apartment seems completely empty, on such short notice. 

The one exception, is when Michael is seen interacting with Hannah (and we're told with the roommate) after he hits her car.  

Is it possible there is some sort of PCS delusion going on with Sherlock with regards to Michael?

The one thing I can't jive with this issue, if my memory is correct regarding Michael's limited interaction with anyone other than Sherlock is correct, is that we witness Michael burying a victim when Sherlock calls him to go to a meeting.   Sherlock is not on to Michael as a serial killer at this point, so the only reason to show that scene is if it is really happening.  It can't be part of any Sherlock delusion. 

Although, where Michael buried that body, a mannequin is found.  We're lead down the path to believe that Michael is so adept at covering his tracks that he knew Sherlock would find it, and he moved the body and buried a mannequin instead, but what if something different is going on...?

I don't know, something about how Michael has limited interactions with people, and they're almost all with Sherlock just struck me as odd.  Also, the way that Watson was investigating a completely empty apartment struck me funny, so I thought I'd throw it out there. 

Just to be clear, I'm not saying Michael is a complete hallucination of Sherlock's, the person obviously exists to some extent, with regards to his interaction with Hannah, and the car connection Gregson discovered, I'm just wondering if there is something more going on than we're able to realize through Sherlock's broken lens; who is mainly who we are seeing Michael through. 

Thanks for listening.  I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts, and be reminded of any scenes involving Michael that I'm failing to remember that might punch holes (or even bolster) the theory.

,elementary,"I am currently rewatching some of my favorite episodes on Hulu while waiting for CBS to upload new ones each week. Something that drew me to the show early on is the remarkable way that the writers approach the non\-romantic intimacy between Sherlock and Watson. 

I've been doing some fan analysis and thought I'd share them, along with throwing out a few questions into the void. Would love to hear from others who may also have given this show way more thought than they should have! 

**Non\-Romantic Love: Watson**

In most serials involving an attractive man and woman working together as partners, romance seems to inevitably become the cornerstone of their relationship and a major plot device. 

While this can still happen in Elementary, the series co\-creator Robert Doherty commented before that this was ""not what we set out to day."" So far, I have not been disappointed at all by their handling of Sherlock and Watson and the commitment to keeping their intimacy out of the realm of romance. Quite the opposite; I'm completely head\-over\-heels in\-love \(ironically\) with their dynamic and how it continues to evolve with every stumble and recovery. For me, this love Sherlock harbors for his beloved friend and partner is such a treat to observe, particularly when it is pointed out to him by other characters \-\- usually for the audience's benefit, I imagine. 

""I think she is the person you love most in the world."" \- Mycroft

""Who do you love more than any other in the world? And what do you think will happen if you stay with her?"" \- Morland

**Romantic Love: Moriarty**

By now, Sherlock's romantic feelings toward Irene are indisputable, though I feel at this point it's less about love and more so acknowledgement that his past with her and their similarities bind them for life. We know for certain Moriarty still cares deeply for Sherlock. 

Going back to the end of Season 1 and rewatching the scene of Moriarty kidnapping Watson to lunch, I noticed the presence of disdain from the former. She was confused by Watson, clearly, and she addressed Sherlock's partner with what I would characterize as jealousy. The way she addresses Watson seemed to be demanding, ""Who the hell are you?""

**Watson and Moriarty**

When Sherlock tells Moriarty that the ""mascot"" figured her out, I assumed he meant that Watson realized the extent of Jamie's love for him. I'm a little unclear about this, though. Was there something else about Moriarty that Watson had deduced? Did I miss something? 

Additionally, I'm very intrigued by Moriarty's feelings toward Watson. She clearly harbors *some* level of obsession toward her, given the giant Watson portrait that pops up periodically. Do you think the show will explore the dynamic between these two? At this point, she seems to have the potential of becoming a shared nemesis for both Sherlock and Watson.",t2_wnb8d,False,,0,False,Women in Sherlock's life: Watson VS Moriarty dynamic,[],r/elementary,False,7,,0,,False,t3_8k7140,False,dark,0.96,,public,26,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,26,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1526614315.0,text,7,,,text,self.elementary,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently rewatching some of my favorite episodes on Hulu while waiting for CBS to upload new ones each week.

,elementary,"So, I've read several theories about what actually happened at the end of the episode 3x4 ""Bella"", what was the significance of the final scene. One thread about the ending of ""Bella"" was posted recently. But I have a theory that hasn't been discussed much. I could be wrong, of course, but I think it could, at the very least, provoke an interesting discussion.


Here it is. So, I always figured the twist at the end was that the computer, ""Bella"", kept asking for ""more information"" not so ""she"" (it?) could provide the best possible answer, but because it had (possibly) developed a desire to learn on its own, meaning that the programmer behind it might have created an actual artificial intelligence, just like he had suspected. Thus, the professor's motive for murdering the programner kind of made sense; artificial intelligence is powerful and dangerous, and things have gone too far.



That was the whole point: dangers, and prospects, of artificial intelligence. People keep feeding Bella information whenever it asks for them (""I don't understand the question. Could I have more information?""), so it could provide them with the best possible answer... Or so they think. They don't realize that they are actually satisfying Bella's own desire for knowledge, thus making it more intelligent and powerful. People are actually playing by Bella's rules.

,elementary,"*Spoilers*




So, back in season two, ""Elementary"" did a semi-adaptation of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", titled ""Hound of the Cancer Cells"". It was very different from the source material: the ""Hound"" in that episode was merely a device that the victim had been working on, supposed to detect cancer in people by ""analyzing"" their body odor (inspired by the real-life phenomenon where actual dogs can smell the cancer cells in their owners). But it is one of my favorite episodes. The case was interesting, with an unexpected but logical reveal, all red-herrings were also interesting, complex, and actually helped move the plot along, and the subplot involving a drug dealer, scared eyewitness and a retired teacher was very moving. Plus, we finally got a break from that Lestrade drama and dreadful Joan/Mycroft romance featured throughout season two. The episode also ends with Sherlock and Marcus finally reconciling, following Marcus getting shot as a result of Sherlock's actions (indirectly, of course) earlier in the season.




Then, in season four, ""Elementary"" did an ""actual"" Baskerville adaptation, titled ""Hounded"". To be fair, that episode was much closer to the original: it actually involved a Baskerville family and a large dog (albeit a robotic one), the motive revolved around the inheritance, etc. That episode also sucked. (Yes, in my opinion.) Since I am a fan of the show and I quite enjoyed season four as a whole, I am going to explain why.




First of all, putting up so much effort into building a mechanical dog, just so you could chase someone off the jogging track to his death, makes no sense. Not only is it way too much effort to murder someone, but there were too many variables that could have thwarted the whole scheme. What if the first victim managed to run to his car, get in and drive away rather, than accidentally jump in front of the moving van? What if the second (attempted; he survived) victim managed to run off to his neighbors instead of running into his pool, like the killer intended?


Plus, a large robot-dog is probably the least subtle murder weapon ever, even if used on an isolated location. What if somebody saw that huge machine chasing the victim? The suspicion would have immediately fallen upon other employees of the company that the victim owned (or financed? I don't remember that part clearly), familiar with that project and expert enough to pull it off. And there actually was a witness to the first murder, but he happened to be a schizophrenic man who perceived the attack as an actual large dog chasing the victim. How convenient! 
Also, Sherlock and Joan narrowly save the second victim's life, because they happen to call him in order to warn him of impending danger... just when the robot dog attacks him. Again, convenient.


I know that plenty of mysteries in ""Elementary"" are contrived or overcomplicated (as in lots of original stories, actually), but that was almost bending the logic backwards to fit the plot. At least in the original novel, the killer used an actual dog, on an isolated private property, and there was an actual folklore about ""the dog from Hell"" adding fuel to the fire, so to say.


And I'm pretty sure that robot would have left some pretty big tracks on the crime scene. Even if the authorities immediately suspected the death was accidental, I imagine they would have canvased the area and noticed, you know, large fresh tracks in the ground, and asked some questions, maybe even seek Sherlock's and Joan's help themselves. And when Sherlock and Joan do search the crime scene, the only tracks they find are some broken branches and indentations in the ground. (To be fair, some time did pass between the victim's death, and Sherlock and Joan being hired to investigate.)


The subplot involving Sherlock and Eugene also went nowhere in particular. It was pretty obvious from the get go Eugene that would eventually consider quitting his job as an M.E. for the NYPD. But later on, he decided to stay anyway. Their conversation was supposed to be moving, but it honestly seemed like a mixture of several different [and much better] conversations that Sherlock and Joan had following Andrew's murder in season three.


Does anyone else agree, or has something to add?

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else agree, or has something to add? I wish they had stopped with 2x18 &amp;quot;The Hound of the Cancer Cells&amp;quot;, or at least tried making 4x16 &amp;quot;Hounded&amp;quot; more believable and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

This really showed how much closer Sherlock is with Marcus now, before yes they'll risk their lives for each other. But they both complained to each other that they're not friends. Now he's considering to attend Marcus's wedding. Before season 3 Marcus would never have invited him, me think.

Which kinda makes it almost reachable. And he mentions that he gets the energy to do these insane things because he is passionate about his work. And he wants each and every skill he can gather to help him in his profession. 
Which kinda makes me want to do that same for my passions as well.

Elementary sure was/is... different. Both as a Sherlock Holmes adaptation, and as a mystery show. They turned doctor Watson into a woman, they feature a man/woman detective duo without any kind of romance angle, the main cast is relatively small and it still hasn't changed (Sherlock, Joan, Thomas Gregson, Marcus Bell). Almost every episode is basically a TIL (not that there is anything wrong with that), exploring and explaining a weird phenomenon, some current trend, a new technology, or a weird but true piece of history. But all of that has worked out pretty well. And critics, too, seem to agree. And there is certainly plenty of material to watch, and a lot to discuss about, with one hundred and twenty episodes and counting. It even inspired a tie-in novel. And both Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are quite well known and respected actors with a decent following. Not to mention Natalie Dormer portraying Moriarty, John Noble portraying Sherlock's father...

While the wait for Elementary Season 6 was a little longer than usual, its early 2018 return is imminent.

NEWS
Den of Geek Staff 

Dec 15, 2017
Sherlock Holmes fans got a little nervous when CBS announced its Fall 2017 schedule and Elementary Season 6 was nowhere to be found. But don't worry, detectives, Elementary Season 6 will eventually get here.

The catch to the Elementary Season 6 renewal? Instead of its usual 24 episodes it will only have 21. Then again, that might not be a bad thing. The show often has a noticeable midseason lag as it gets into more cookie cutter procedural territory, so perhaps the shorter episode order will work in its favor.

""One of the changes in having so much midseason is that, look, repeats aren't working as well as they used to,"" CBS CEO Les Moonves said at the network upfront. ""It's good to have originals all the way through, so if you take a Code Black, it was on Wednesday night and doing decently on Wednesday night. There's no reason that Criminal Minds couldn't come off for a short period of time and you put in Code Black and you continue with originals all the way through. Same with Elementary on a Sunday night or a Thursday night, things like that. So you have a lot more leeway to do things.""

To be fair, CBS did Elementary no favors last year, constantly bumping it around the Sunday night schedule whenever NFL games ran overtime, which was often. 

Elementary Season 6 Release Date

Elementary Season 6 is currently speculated to make an early-2018 debut in a new timeslot of Sundays at 8 p.m. There, Elementary would replace the Jeremy Piven-starring crime drama, Wisdom of the Crowd, which has just been cancelled, due to low ratings and sexual assault allegations against its star. 

Looking at the calendar, the absolute earliest when Elementary Season 6 could premiere would be Sunday, January 7. While the season was expanded to 21 episodes, it will also stand as the first outing to not contain its standard 24. Its previous timeslot was Sundays at 10 p.m., 9 central.

Elementary Season 6 Cast

Desmond Harrington joins the cast for Elementary Season 6 as a regular, reports TV Line. Harrington's character, Michael, is a recovering addict who was apparently inspired by Sherlock's handling of his own chemical dependency dilemma and reaches out to him. The fanboying will prove fortuitous, since Season 6 will find Sherlock in need of the kind of support that only a fellow former addict can provide, since, as we saw at the end of Season 5, a brain scan revealed the reason he's having (Mr. Robot-like) conversations with an imaginary woman revealed to be his dead mother.

Harrington, an American actor, is probably best known for his run on Showtime's Dexter as Detective Joey Quinn. However, his resume also includes notable television runs on series such as Limitless, The Astronaut Wives Club, Gossip Girl, Rescue Me and Dragnet (2003 reboot). He also has notable film appearances in the dark, lascivious 2016 drama The Neon Demon, 2012 Batman trilogy closer The Dark Knight Rises and the 2003 horror film Wrong Turn.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m only 4 episodes in so far and I have to ask... how the hell did this get a reputation for being a &amp;quot;dumbed down American ripoff&amp;quot;??   Just from these first FOUR episodes, I&amp;#39;m already getting more character development, more heart, better writing and more engaging mysteries than what I experienced from the entire run of Sherlock with its convoluted plots and over-reliance on Moriarty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit it, I really wasn&amp;#39;t expecting much going in.  I was expecting to watch 1-2 episodes and regret ever giving it a chance.  But if the rest of the episodes are anything like what I&amp;#39;ve seen so far, this is the modern Sherlock Holmes series I always should&amp;#39;ve been watching.  Now my biggest regret is not starting sooner... but at least I now have 5 (hopefully solid) full seasons to enjoy.  That said, are there any I should skip or are they all worth a watch?&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"Hello Fellow Sober Companions!

Good news everyone! The watery tart has finally thrown a sword at me! I have control over the subreddit, as you can already see since I made an update to the sidebar(it's an off season joke. get it?)

The first thing I'd like to do is establish my role in this: It would give me no greater joy than to keep running things with a vaguely hands-off approach. I like reading, doing a little cleanup and I'm more than willing to do a little maintenance here and there. I'm pretty good at making decisions and telling people what to do as well, but I'll try and keep that part reined in. Maybe.

So I've got 4 jobs in the coming weeks:

* Sprucing up the groundwork-We've grown a bit as a community, we've seen some diverse content coming in. It's about time we got some real hard rule sets in:when to report, what's spam, what needs to message and when. I'll establish a ground level list and get it posted for you guys and we'll have a chat about it when it gets posted so we can iron out any wrinkles. In addition, I'll be adding to the sidebar. Stay tuned!

* Getting in new mods-Look, I like to think I'm pretty clever. Reasonably, I walk around this earth doing dumb things without making a ton of enemies and staying alive. But I'd like to grow things and step 1 to growing things is getting people in here to help me grow things. People who can do things I reasonably cannot do. So, I'm *he hesitates slightly as he types this* looking for new mods. Once the rules are good I will open up a google form to get that taken care of.  More details to follow!

* I'd like to update the look. For some of you with a bit more artistic skill, we'll be doing a context for a customized banner and more. How we'll organize it I'll discuss with the mods, but suffice to say please start brainstorming now

* Updating the automod-For a long time I assumed we had the automod setup because the spam filter is working. Doesn't appear to be the case. So this being my area of least ability, we'll be opening this up to someone with a bit more programming experience at the same time as the mods.

That's about it for updates. Please let me know here if you have any suggestions or questions. 

My timetable to have this whole operation wrapped up is the beginning of November, which is about when we'd probably see the first Elementary promos for a winter premiere.

Is it just me? I mean, it has been used more in later seasons, but season five was almost unbearable. In almost every episode, the killer turns out to be some arrogant, rich man/woman who committed a murder, often multiple murders, hoping that those deaths would set some bigger events in motion (or set them back, in some cases). The events that would help his/her career, of course.


In 5x6 ""Ill Tidings"", the guy murdered eight people and issued a fake terrorist threat just so he'd distract everyone and get a chance to steal expensive paintings from a government building. In 5x15 ""Wrong Side of the Road"" and 5x16 ""Fidelity"", the villain orchestrated five deaths and participated in a terrorist attack that resulted in thirty six fatalities... just so he'd obtain the materials necessary to pull off a scam, that would lead to USA starting a war with Iran. Why? For some unspecified reason (the implication being that he really, really doesn't like Iran). There are many more examples (especially in season five), but those two annoyed me the most.


I mean, it was fun at first, because such reveals/motives were unexpected. But they are only unexpected if you don't use them almost every episode. Almost every episode, I find myself wondering: ""So, what's the real story behind this? What larger events would those deaths set in motion?""


Interestingly, some of the best episodes are the ones with simple motives. Episode 4x7, ""Miss Taken"" (awesome pun title, by the was), is one of the highest rated episodes on IMDb, and the movie can be summed up in: a con artist murders an FBI agent who threatened to expose her. Yes, her con scheme was pretty convulted, but something similar has happened in real life. (Except for the hair stealing part.)

,elementary,"Series finale probably depends on how will the writers resolve Sherlock's brain damage arc. If they'll go with Sherlock having a concussion/brain swelling due to the blows to the head, which may go down after a while, I think that temporary brain injury could make Sherlock think about his life purpose and his calling. He may lose confidence in his detective abilities, and come to think that he isn't much without his deduction skills. After getting better, he may decide to retire soon, after ""his summer contract with NYPD is up"", sort of an inside joke. (I assume there are contracts involved, even though neither he nor Joan are getting paid, since Sherlock was suspended once or twice and had to go to a disciplinary court in season two.)


If the writers decide to bring the Moriarty arc back, Sherlock might decide to retire after finally taking down Moriarty's organization once and for all (even more difficult and interesting now that his father is the leader). So the final few episodes of the series may focus on Sherlock and Joan trying to bring Moriarty's empire down. Hopefully, Natalie Dormer makes an appearance.


Or, instead of a Moriarty arc, in the final four-five episodes of ""Elementary"", several perps that Sherlock and Joan captured over the years escape from prison together, ready to exact revenge upon our favorite detective duo. Thus providing the viewers with an interesting, exciting finale and reminding them of all the good moments from earlier seasons.

I've been thinking where would that leave Sherlock and Joan, how to make the finale really memorable. On the one hand, Sherlock and Joan ending up together would be cliche.

,elementary,"Like I've stated before, I think season five of ""Elementary"" was kind of lacking. I think the main problem is that there was no real season-long arc, except for Shinwell problem (yes, problem), which didn't really work because it didn't feature anything really intriguing nor mysterious (a gang war), and Shinwell wasn't really close nor important to either Sherlock and Joan. 


As for the cases of the week, the motives were almost the same in every episode too: a perp murders somebody in order to set a series of events in motion (mostly something that would discredit a certain product, or a person). Thus benefiting the perp's career and landing him or her more money.


Of course, there were still some good episodes, there were some mediocre episodes, and... I may be the only one, but I found the two-part episode, featuring Kitty's return, to be probably the worst of season five. It is sort of a thing that leaves you saying: ""What was that?"" on the end.


Some things wrong with it:


1) The perp realizes that Sherlock, Joan (and Kitty) are on to something. They suspect that the DA's death was a murder, they'd like to have the body exhumed. So he digs up the body at night, burns it down and just leaves it at the cemetery?


That is a no win situation anyway. If the body is exhumed, and it is determined that the victim was murdered, the investigators (Sherlock, Joan and Kitty, in this case) will investigate further. If you get to the body before it can be exhumed, dig it up, set it on fire and just leave it there... I'm pretty sure that's the reason enough to investigate further, even if the murder can't be forensically proven.


2) Kitty has a child so she decides to quit being a consulting detective? I'm not going to call it sexist, and it is somewhat believable, but that is still really cliche. And I'm still not sure where the writers are with the whole ""gift or a course"" issue. We are supposed to admire Sherlock and Joan's abilities and be happy when they are solving cases for our amusement every week, but every now and then the writers are flat out telling us that one can't leave ""normal"" (well, traditional) life while being in that profession. Well, maybe they don't want normal, traditional life, but, in comparison, Kitty seems perfectly happy to ditch detective career so she could raise her daughter. So... is something wrong with Sherlock and Joan? Are we supposed to feel sorry for them? I find such implications to be pretty off putting.


3) How come neither Sherlock nor Joan noticed any evidence of Kitty having a baby? 


4) With the risk of sounding offensive, are we supposed to believe that 60+ nanny was able to overpower Joan? Did that woman have military training or something?


5) Apparently, an experienced FBI agent, who orchestrated a terrorist attack in Venezuela, murdered several people in UK as well as USA, and planted the fake evidence that would lead to a WW3, also... falsified the aforementioned evidence in his mother's basement, went to hide in his mother's house after realizing that the police was after him, and got shot in the arm and was subsequently arrested because he happened to stand too close to the window. 

And his mother was upstairs while he was falsifying that evidence in the basement, and she called out for her dog while her son was videotaping his scheme, so that voice recording became a crucial piece of evidence against him.


6) So, in the end, Kitty was back due to the case that she thought would put her and Sherlock in danger, but in the end, it turns out that they were never really in danger. And she has a baby and she will no longer be a detective. Neat.


Hopefully, the writing will improve the next season. But I'm still baffled as to why would anyone... well... write a two-part episodes like this. And use it to return Kitty.",t2_sycd7,False,,0,False,Kitty's return in season five-the writing was close to awful,[],r/elementary,False,7,,0,,False,t3_6ojcln,False,dark,0.86,,public,21,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,21,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1500614238.0,text,7,,,text,self.elementary,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;ve stated before, I think season five of &amp;quot;Elementary&amp;quot; was kind of lacking. I think the main problem is that there was no real season-long arc, except for Shinwell problem (yes, problem), which didn&amp;#39;t really work because it didn&amp;#39;t feature anything really intriguing nor mysterious (a gang war), and Shinwell wasn&amp;#39;t really close nor important to either Sherlock and Joan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the cases of the week, the motives were almost the same in every episode too: a perp murders somebody in order to set a series of events in motion (mostly something that would discredit a certain product, or a person). Thus benefiting the perp&amp;#39;s career and landing him or her more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were still some good episodes, there were some mediocre episodes, and... I may be the only one, but I found the two-part episode, featuring Kitty&amp;#39;s return, to be probably the worst of season five. It is sort of a thing that leaves you saying: &amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot; on the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things wrong with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The perp realizes that Sherlock, Joan (and Kitty) are on to something. They suspect that the DA&amp;#39;s death was a murder, they&amp;#39;d like to have the body exhumed. So he digs up the body at night, burns it down and just leaves it at the cemetery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a no win situation anyway. If the body is exhumed, and it is determined that the victim was murdered, the investigators (Sherlock, Joan and Kitty, in this case) will investigate further. If you get to the body before it can be exhumed, dig it up, set it on fire and just leave it there... I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that&amp;#39;s the reason enough to investigate further, even if the murder can&amp;#39;t be forensically proven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Kitty has a child so she decides to quit being a consulting detective? I&amp;#39;m not going to call it sexist, and it is somewhat believable, but that is still really cliche. And I&amp;#39;m still not sure where the writers are with the whole &amp;quot;gift or a course&amp;quot; issue. We are supposed to admire Sherlock and Joan&amp;#39;s abilities and be happy when they are solving cases for our amusement every week, but every now and then the writers are flat out telling us that one can&amp;#39;t leave &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; (well, traditional) life while being in that profession.

,elementary,"Plenty of people in this community seem to think that Elementary's last season was kind of lacking. I agree. Reasons for that are varying. But I think we can all agree that ""Elementary"" seriously lacks a good villain story (as of the last two or so seasons, I mean), and that it could ""break"" the format more often (do a two-part episode, have an episode set outside of New York...)


Though I still have no idea what is wrong with Sherlock's brain/memory and how will that play out in the next season, I've got something regarding an aforementioned problem with the show.


This is the idea I've come up with. One night, Sherlock gets a call from a person who claims that she's about to murder someone. (Using ""she "" because the caller/the killer turns out to be a woman, but that isn't clear at the beginning. She doesn't reveal much about herself and she's using a voice changer.)


So, she (the caller) tells Sherlock that he has one minute to talk her out of it. Sherlock does his best, but fails; the caller hangs up after announcing that she will murder her hostage, and that Sherlock can expect another call soon. 


Sherlock and Joan immediately inform Gregson and Bell, but forensic techs can't identify the caller or pinpoint the exact location because the caller used a burner phone, and turned it off after calling Sherlock. Sherlock has managed to record the call though, and he and Joan identify the victim's location through the background noises. But by the time they locate the victim, it is too late: she is dead and the killer is long gone. The victim was a prostitute, murdered in her home: the killer slit her throat and mutilated her body post-mortem. Sherlock soon realizes that the M.O. is identical to the way Jack the Ripper killed and mutilated his last confirmed victim, Mary Jane Kelly (which was, arguably, his most gruesome and notorious murder).


A few days later, Sherlock ends up receiving another phone call, with the same taunt and the same request. Once again, he fails to talk the killer out of murdering her victim. (Though it is obvious that the killer doesn't have any actual intention of letting the victim go, no matter what, and she just wants to taunt Sherlock.) After pinpointing the victim's location, they rush to the crime scene, but once again, it is too late. This time, the victim is a young female jogger. She had been strangled to death, her throat cut post-mortem, her breasts mutilated. Sherlock realizes that the M.O. is identical to the way Joseph Vacher, ""The French Ripper"", murdered his first victim. He figures that his latest enemy has been copying the M.O. of famous serial killers, in ""chronological order"" (Jack the Ripper was killing in 1888 while Joseph Vacher was killing from 1894 to 1897).


Eventually, it turns out that a serial killer is a woman that Sherlock apprehended years ago, in London. She murdered a guy who raped her (revenge, not self defense), and Sherlock identified her as the killer and found evidence against her. She spent over a decade in prison, and, soon after being released, she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, giving her about a year to live. (That could make the case even more personal for Sherlock, if he'd have to deal with having a brain tumor or brain damage himself.) Having discovered that Sherlock Holmes was responsible for her capture, and that he currently resides in New York, she made her way to there and became a serial killer, copying the M.O. of other famous serial killers, because she ""wants to be remembered"". (I believe that, in UK, you can have an active passport even after being convicted of a serious crime, such as manslaughter. I could be wrong though.) She'd call Sherlock before the murders to taunt him and to make sure he'll witness her ""work"", believing that he ""ruined her life"".


The episode could be a two-parter. By the end of the first episode, Sherlock and Joan identify the killer, but she manages to evade capture (possibly by escaping through sewer system, which is, possibly, the way Jack the Ripper would flee the scenes of his crimes). By the time Sherlock and Joan realize how she escaped them and what is her next move, she has already fled back to London, using fake credentials. So Sherlock and Joan decide to travel to London and continue their investigation there. They win, of course.

While in London, they could also discover another crime with Moriarty (as of season four finale, Sherlock's father) behind it, and encounter Morland Holmes again, possibly leading to a longer series arc. Also, Kitty could make an appearance.

Though that wouldn't be very likely, I'd like to see Keira Knightley portray that villain (a copycat serial killer, I mean).

,elementary,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I've been a huge fan of the series since the beginning, and have re-watched each season multiple times. I had intended to write this post around episode 6 of this season, so I apologize for my tardiness. Also, please note that I have only seen up through episode 6, as I have chosen to take a break from Elementary. I'll also say that JLM is my favorite Sherlock Holmes.

Here's the rub: Is it just me, or has the series fallen off lately? It just feels like either the writers or the actors or the studio just don't care anymore. It doesn't feel like their hearts are in it now. The first season was beyond amazing. The second season was great. The third season was pretty cool. Fourth season was alright I suppose. And now we have season five which just feels dull.

(These are of course just my opinions, but I'll explain why.)

In the first two or three seasons, especially earlier-on, we see Sherlock in all his chaotic and quirky glory. He was always doing something new or exciting or obnoxious or brilliant to either keep himself busy and distracted, hone his skills, or work the case...not to mention the occasional romp with one or more women. He would surprise Watson in various ways. He was also considerably more charming, but also more upsetting or off-putting as a counterweight. Overall I found Sherlock more dynamic. Now we see a dull, calm shadow of the former Holmes. The evolution in his clothing makes sense, as he has become less shattered and more centered. His arrogance, inconsideration and anti-social tendencies used to be endearing. And they were usually followed by growth in his character.

Now they seem to just recycle the same crap about him being averse to gatherings, recognition, etc. Sherlock used to take risks, often with steep prices attached, but there's just no need for that anymore. Nothing has really happened to shake the damn foundation! Not since season 3, anyway

I suppose Watson is more/less the same, if not a bit more subdued as well. Alfredo is just gone. I'm not sure if they've followed-up with Kitty Winter at all, but again I have not season past episode 6 this season.

I just saw a post that mentioned that there haven't been any brilliant villains lately. That ties into what I wanted to say about the plot devices and arcs becoming very bland as well. Sure, Season 4 may have surprised us at a couple turns, done some things unexpected, but not like the first 3 seasons. To speak plainly, we saw some crazy shit go down in 1 - 3. Not just the surprises, the villains, the close brushes with death or parting of the ways, but also the social issues the writers tackled. The emotional issues as well. They dissected drug addiction, sexual abuse, high-level corruption, interpersonal relationships, mental and emotional frailty/instability. And they even managed to throw some really, truly beautiful moments of reflection in there. The letters between Holmes &amp; Moriarty, the developing bond between Watson &amp; Holmes, the friendship and mutual salvation between Holmes &amp; Winter, The mentorship and eventual friendship of Sherlock &amp; Alfredo, just to name a few. And there were these moments, many of them very quotable, that were so mystically inspired that I found myself with tears in my eyes on more than one occasion.

And how could I forget all the subtle humor!? The dialogue was fantastic. And the character development, while that was still a thing, hit the mark. It seems now though that they've simply stopped. As though they're just done developing...done being dynamic people.

I better stop now before I remember anything else I wanted to rant about.

**TL;DR**: In my opinion, as of S5E6, Elementary has lost the life and soul that it once had. It feels like the creators, cast &amp; writers are over it. I'm very bummed out. Feel free to share your thoughts &amp; perspectives.",t2_15w0n6,False,,0,False,[Mostly Rant/Welcome Discussion] [Probably Spoilers] What happened to Elementary?,[],r/elementary,False,7,,0,,False,t3_650bcc,False,dark,0.82,,public,24,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,24,,False,spoiler,1492028701.0,,[],{},,True,,1492053405.0,text,7,,,text,self.elementary,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to preface this by saying that I&amp;#39;ve been a huge fan of the series since the beginning, and have re-watched each season multiple times. I had intended to write this post around episode 6 of this season, so I apologize for my tardiness. Also, please note that I have only seen up through episode 6, as I have chosen to take a break from Elementary. I&amp;#39;ll also say that JLM is my favorite Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rub: Is it just me, or has the series fallen off lately? It just feels like either the writers or the actors or the studio just don&amp;#39;t care anymore. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel like their hearts are in it now. The first season was beyond amazing. The second season was great. The third season was pretty cool. Fourth season was alright I suppose. And now we have season five which just feels dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(These are of course just my opinions, but I&amp;#39;ll explain why.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first two or three seasons, especially earlier-on, we see Sherlock in all his chaotic and quirky glory. He was always doing something new or exciting or obnoxious or brilliant to either keep himself busy and distracted, hone his skills, or work the case...not to mention the occasional romp with one or more women. He would surprise Watson in various ways. He was also considerably more charming, but also more upsetting or off-putting as a counterweight. Overall I found Sherlock more dynamic. Now we see a dull, calm shadow of the former Holmes. The evolution in his clothing makes sense, as he has become less shattered and more centered. His arrogance, inconsideration and anti-social tendencies used to be endearing. And they were usually followed by growth in his character.&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"Alright, we need to have a quick chat guys. Its a bit apparent that yes, until someone answers my request for full powers that I need a little help policing and regulating the place. We're relatively low traffic so it's not a huge deal if something comes up, I usually am on a spam post within a few hours. Ive gotten into the habit of checking the place at least 3 times a day at various times and clearing the queue as often as possible.

But look, some of you have gotten a bit happy with the report button or have been a little unhappy with my response time, so we need to have a chat about what can be done to spruce things up.

First off: the report button is not a complaint box for content you don't like. Reporting clothes posts, people whos opinions you don't agree with or generally sillier posts as spam or the like isn't going to make that happen if I don't feel like someone actually broke a rule, and generally I allow a decent degree of flexibility. 

But if you fill up the queue with false reports then I will spend more time determining what is a real violation and what isn't, which leads to actual spam staying on while I look at stuff. And yeah, we do have a spam bot in place for many out of context or weird comments, but it doesn't catch submissions sometimes. The old mods must have set it up weird. I dunno.

Now for the other half of the coin: look guys, I'm one guy, I have a job and I can't add or subtract mods. I just don't have the permissions. If you want something cleared out asap shoot me a measage or better: hit message the mods. I use a 3rd party app and I get a push notification when I leave the app open. Itll get done as quick as I can answer them at work.

When the time comes, we'll be sprucing up the subreddit as much as possible: new mods, bots, new themes, new faq and lists and etc.

1.	We know that the Show takes place in New York City, So that is a given
2.	From the Buildings in the back ground listed left to right:
 * 	Empire state building in Green
 *	Chrysler Building in White
 *	Citi-Group Center
 *	432 Park Ave.

 	With these building in this order, we are able to say that the East River in full View of the Camera.  There are 10 Bridges that Span the East River. 

 * Brooklyn Bridge

 * Manhattan Bridge

 * Williamsburg Bridge

 * Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge

 * Roosevelt Island Bridge

 * Triborough Bridge (Suspension Bridge)

 * Hell Gate Bridge

 * Rikers Island Bridge

 * Bronx–Whitestone Bridge

 * Throgs Neck Bridge


We can see that there are two shore lines when looking at the picture. Meaning that there is an Island in the river. Only One of the aforementioned Bridges span the width of the East River and Crosses an Island.  The Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.  

So now we Know that we are looking At Manhattan from Queens. While being South of the Queensboro Bridge.

3.	Take note of the Roof Architecture of the Building Holmes and Watson are on.  The Roof line is not built on a 90° corner. The Majority of “Brownstone” Residential building were built from the years 1868 into the 1890s.   Not with 100% certainty I can say that most Brownstone Style Residential Building were built using 90° corners.  With this being said, the building they are on is not a residential building. Or at least the one we see them enter.

4.	We can Use Satellite Imagery Now that we know The Building is in Queens and is South of the Queensboro Bridge.
 * 	Note that the building’s roof has doors on the South side with one needed Stairs, This is not entirely unique but would aid in the viewing form great heights. 
 * 	We find ourselves at   10-10 44th Ave, Long Island City, NY 11101 Which is the Roof Used in Elementary that gives us the Iconic and Beautiful View of New York.

,elementary,"I guess this is more like a rant, but I need, absolutely need to get it out of my system. It's a story of how I stopped worrying and learned to enjoy Elementary.

So, I was watching BBC Sherlock all these years. Now, mind you, very casually. Like, I'd watch a season once when it came out, and then maybe after a year or before the new season rolls out, rewatch it. The first two seasons, I was extremely impressed - by the cinematography and acting, first of all, by the unusual take on Holmes himself. I found the series to be clever and very competently made. Not to the point of fanboying, but I was very curious to see where the show would take its borderline robotic lead and adrenaline-junkie sidekick next after the Moriarty suicide stint.

I *didn't* expect them to take it into a crazy, sappy sci-fi soap opera direction, rife with amnesiacs and popping up hidden relatives from supermax asylums. 

Like, at all. I didn't expect the show to introduce a 50-year old tired woman as a super-spy. I didn't expect the plotlines to devolve to ""I care about you, Sherlock - no, I care about you more, John - no, John and Sherlock, I care about you the more-est"" nonesense melodrama. I didn't expect for Watson's character to *degrade* and become more useless and helpless as it was before - seriously, someone needs to do a montage of Martin Freeman looking confused from S3 and S4, I wager it would be like an hour in length, if not more.

Mystery? Plots? Logic? Who the fuck needs those, when you can have, gasp, SHENANIGANS? Now, Im not going to nitpick every damn inconsistency that plagued the BBC Sherlock since S2 (that would require writing a whole book), but just point out the things I found actually insulting to me as a viewer, because they are stretching the plausibility of things way too far:

- John Watson, a man of very ordinary qualities, gets surrounded by a slew of super-spies, super-intellects and near damn meta-humans, because...? Like, ok, I can believe their friendship with Sherlock and acquaintance with Mycroft, but Mary took it over the fucking board.How many geniuses does one get in their life?

- Sherlock's deduction skills gradually morphing into outright clairvoyance and Mary Sue powers

- Inconsistency in character development. Firstly, only Sherlock shows signs of gradual character development, all the other characters remain where they were in the start. I realize that the show tried to pull off the whole ""Sherlock begins to humanize through close relationships with other people"", but its a very much ""telling, no showing"" thing. I still don't get why he became such a self-sacrificing martyr all of a sudden, why he made such leaps into caring for others when these ""others"" have no agencies or distinctive values of their own...

- Which brings me to the absolutely central for me, problem, the lack of agency in BBC's Watson. Maybe I was spoiled by Vitaly Solomins and Jude Law's Watsons, but the fact that Freemans Watson, after the badassery of the first episode effectively became a male *damsel in distress*, was so unwarranted it left me sorely disappointed in the series. Every season I was looking for that momen when Watson finally gathers wits and guts - and it never came.

- The Fuckin Finale. Oh boy, where to start. Ok, so, it's effectively a fanfic. Retconning a super-sister super-villain like a Tumblrite self-insert. Sherlock having posttraumatic amnesia. ""Reprogramming skills"". ""Hello, Sherlock. I want to play a game"". Supervillain lair and ""mind games"". Stanford experiments. Unholy doses of drama. DVD farwells. Great detective cant tell there's no fucking glass in a cell with a lot of lights that SHOULDA REFLECTED ON IT. Eurus being the ""mind that defines the century"" by finding the cure to AIDS? By proving the string theory, mayhap? By creating brilliant works of art? Oh no, silly, we just gotta believe Mycroft cuz he says so and cuz she can make prison guards go cuckoo. And, all of this supervillain, pure intellect of evil needed, is just a bro hug. 

It was so horrible, it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's like I accidentally watched Twilight or Fifty Shades of Gray. It was bad, bad, BAD. It was all tell, and no show. It was Sherlock being a merciful god, and everyone else who's not from the ""totally believablr trio of genius siblings"", bumbling useless fools. It was melodramatic and choppy.

So there I sat, fuming about self-indulgent writers, when my eye fell on the news that a new episode of ""Elementary"" is now available for streaming. I vaguely remembered that the show was running for a few years on local TV station, and that some major Hollywood stars headlining it. And, it was about Sherlock Holmes as well!

When it came out, I watched little TV, and having now followed any drama between it and the BBC version, I didn't have any preconceptions about it. I jyst wanted to wash the terrible memories of S4 outta my mind, so I cautiously gave it a go.

My God, what a breath of fresh air! Now, I'm not familiar with the genre of procedurals at all. The closest I ever watched to it must be X-Files, Hannibal amd Dexter, and since I enjoyed these shows, slipping into Elementary was without the burden of having watched to much of the same.

Needless to say, after the second episode I was convinced that what CBS did was far superior to the convoluted fan-wreck BBC spat out recently. It addressed nearly all of the major problems I had with Sherlock, and stood in its own right.

More realistic Holmes? Fuck yes, please. Jonny Lee Miller's and the writer's interpretation is far more believable than Cumberbatch's. I get that people love their insufferable sociopathic autists, but JLM's portrays dysfunction in a more subdued, nuanced manner that is actually much more complicated and multi-layered than BBC's straight delivery of the Nietzchian ubermensch of rationality. He's more relatable, at least to me, and there is a cleverness of writing that suggests complex background that is absent in BBC's solid and unmutable take on the character. Honestly, I like realism more than flashy fanfare. Through flaws and occasional ineptitude, the show made me care and root for the titular character far more than for Cumberbatch's counterpart.
With BBC I never felt ""worried"" for Sherlock. He was too smart, too good at everything despite the social shenanigans, written so much like a staunch protagonist that I felt with my gut that the character has 10-mm plot armor. Elementary's Sherlock doesn't feel that way, doesn't feel like when he hurts, it will be quickly abated and swept under the rug.

Watson. WATSON! Now, that is a Watson I wanted! I couldn't care less about the characters gender or race (and it goes both ways, tbh, I don't give points to the character simply cuz it's not a white male, that's dumb as fuck as much as dismissing them because they're an Asian woman), I care about attiude and agency! And Elementary has heaps of it. Joan Watson isn't a useless, adoring appendage to Holmes like in BBC's version, she's her own person with a rather strong presence, someone who can stand their ground and has a life outside of the adventures. Not a prop. She can defend herself, she can learn from Sherlock, she can act independently and walk on his turf. Brilliant, 50 points to CBS.

Supporting cast. Im only on S1E16 of Elementary now (protracting the pleasure, so to speak), so maybe many more characters arent introduced yet, but still, what a marked difference in portraying supporting cast and police in general.

In Sherlock, I don't even get why the police is there. Like Watson, they're useless cutouts to serve as a background for Holmes' brilliance and a source of jokes at their expense and plot bridging. In Elementary, woah, police are an integral part of the investigation - who woudda thunked! They're not total incompetent idiots, and their occasional bitterness at Sherlock's smartassery isn't the focal point of the relationships.

Themes. And here I finally get to the meat of my rant. Elementary, due to the tone and format and chosen narrative, at least for the time being, doesn't treat me as an idiot, and doesn't insult my intelligence.

Thing is, propping Sherlock as this ice-queen, almost infallible, ten steps ajead of everyone, superman, required BBC's writers to come up with increasingly more outlandish and outrageous plots to match the level of badass awesomeness Sherlock was at. And because there was noone else his equal amongst the protagonists, they sought refuge in damsel-like plotlines, where everything and everyone is at stake. When Moffat and Gatiss came to their senses and tried to introduce character growth and vulnerability to the character, and make the show's tone more intimate in S3, it backfired as unnatural, out-of-the-blue melodrama, that personally, jarred a lot. And S4 wasa combination of the worst from those themes - melodrama and outrageous complicated shit, with magician like resolutions. Dudes, Im not dumb, Im a writer myself, and this is called twisting your premise into a corner.

Elementary, on the other hand, is more self-contained. At least for now (S1), it doesn't deal with earth-shattering conspiracies and James Bond villains - the procedural format allows the plot to focus on character development and streamlined mystery, rather than a messy tangle of references, loopholes and cliffhanger questions. JLM's Sherlock can overlook or be mistaken about things, which allows to resolve plot incontingencies with more realism. Moreover, it doesn't run after a spectacle, and there is no need, therefore, to adjust the characters to fit that spectacle despite their previous characterizations. In short, it doesn't pull bunnies out of its hat and leave you with a WTF reaction. The ability to have filler case episode doesnt push the shows creators to squeeze out bombastic arcs just for the sake of it.

I also enjoy the fact that Elementary doesn't stretch my belief in the relationships between Sherlock and Joan. There are palpable reasons as to why Sherlock sees a partner in Watson, and why she is drawn to his company as well. In BBC - well, I mentioned it already, as the show progressed, Watson didn't actually grow in any capacity.

And the heroin addiction, as Damocles sword hanging over the characters head, adds to the uncertainty and realism of action/consequence that Elementary has and Sherlock doesn't. That ability for characters to experience consequences for their actions, is a highlight of the CBS series, while the absence of it in the BBC show is what made it intolerable, and frankly, stupid.

So that's my take, sorry for the horridly long read. Im just happy I found a very nice smartly written show, that doesn't happen often.",t2_vb3p3,False,,0,False,"Finally, a Sherlock Holmes show that doesn't insult my intelligence",[],r/elementary,False,7,,0,,False,t3_5srqcf,False,dark,0.96,,public,103,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,103,,False,self,1486546792.0,,[],{},,True,,1486575400.0,text,7,,,text,self.elementary,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess this is more like a rant, but I need, absolutely need to get it out of my system.

The ability to have filler case episode doesnt push the shows creators to squeeze out bombastic arcs just for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy the fact that Elementary doesn&amp;#39;t stretch my belief in the relationships between Sherlock and Joan. There are palpable reasons as to why Sherlock sees a partner in Watson, and why she is drawn to his company as well. In BBC - well, I mentioned it already, as the show progressed, Watson didn&amp;#39;t actually grow in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the heroin addiction, as Damocles sword hanging over the characters head, adds to the uncertainty and realism of action/consequence that Elementary has and Sherlock doesn&amp;#39;t. That ability for characters to experience consequences for their actions, is a highlight of the CBS series, while the absence of it in the BBC show is what made it intolerable, and frankly, stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my take, sorry for the horridly long read. Im just happy I found a very nice smartly written show, that doesn&amp;#39;t happen often.&lt;/p&gt;

Five seasons is the golden minimum for syndication, so they managed that. Sunday at 10 is certainly a worrisome time slot. I am not convinced the traditional mystery viewers have warmed to a tattooed, recovering addict Sherlock and a female Asian Watson. 

Indeed I think the tattoos are the prime reason JLM donned buttoned up long sleeve shirts halfway through season one when the first viewer feedback came in. 

Certainly the show is ripe for mega story arc conclusions: does Moriarty get freed? Does Moreland take down the syndicate or does he have to battle Moriarty? Does Mycroft return and the three Holmes men team up in an epic battle for good? Etc.

I really hope if the series is to end they are at least allowed a few extra episodes to answer some interesting character questions.

We're back from our winter break with a brand new episode! Big things coming in the next few weeks, including guest stars coming in the next few weeks!

Synopsis: Holmes and Watson race to find a woman who's been held captive for years before the kidnapper takes drastic steps to avoid being caught. Also, Watson becomes frustrated when Shinwell refuses to focus on his informant training with her and Holmes

I would consider it to be more of a 'collective who solves mysteries' than a company who is trying to turn a profit. 

If I were them, I would 'hire' on people like that girl in tonight's episode who worked at true romantix and hated her job (I would go more into details here, but I'm being nice and not spoiling too much for yall).

They have come across various different people who could pull off stuff like that for them they could keep on retainer for when they need them.

,elementary,"The episode is titled 'Heroine', and alludes to Watson being the 'heroine' of the episode, realizing how Sherlock can beat Moriarty.

I just realized it's also word play - rhymes with *heroin*. As a feint, Sherlock pretends to have relapsed on heroin in order to attract Moriarty's visit.

I looked through the AV Club review and discussion and nobody seems to have noticed this.

,elementary,"""We have spilled much ink, you and I, in our discussion of human connection and we're no closer to understanding than we were when the correspondence began.


I often feel as if I'm standing on one side of a wide chasm, shouting across, and wondering if the response I hear comes from you, or if it is my own voice echoing back to me. It seems to me, on my side of the canyon, that the search for unity with another the font of the world's unhappiness.


I watch as Watson, eager as ever to extract some meaning from the prevailing social conventions, endures a series of curated mating rituals. It seems to me that she's incrementally less content each time she returns from one.


I conduct myself as though I'm above matters of the heart, chiefly because I have seen them corrode people I respect. But in my candid moments, I sometimes wonder if I take the stance I do because love, for lack of a better word, is a game I fail to understand, and so I opt not to play. After all, if I truly had the purity of all my convictions, I wouldn't regret so many of the things I've done.


Nor would I persist, against so many of my better instincts, in this correspondence. I find you a challenge, one that, in spite of all that you've done, continues to stimulate.

&lt;p&gt;I often feel as if I&amp;#39;m standing on one side of a wide chasm, shouting across, and wondering if the response I hear comes from you, or if it is my own voice echoing back to me. It seems to me, on my side of the canyon, that the search for unity with another the font of the world&amp;#39;s unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watch as Watson, eager as ever to extract some meaning from the prevailing social conventions, endures a series of curated mating rituals. It seems to me that she&amp;#39;s incrementally less content each time she returns from one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conduct myself as though I&amp;#39;m above matters of the heart, chiefly because I have seen them corrode people I respect. But in my candid moments, I sometimes wonder if I take the stance I do because love, for lack of a better word, is a game I fail to understand, and so I opt not to play. After all, if I truly had the purity of all my convictions, I wouldn&amp;#39;t regret so many of the things I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would I persist, against so many of my better instincts, in this correspondence. I find you a challenge, one that, in spite of all that you&amp;#39;ve done, continues to stimulate. And so the conversation, futile though it may finally be, continues, and we are left to wonder: have we simply failed to find the answers to the questions that preoccupy us or can they not be answered at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for both of us, the world always presents the next diversion the next elaborate distraction from the problems that vex.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"I recently came up with an idea to end a season finale of ""Elementary"" on a game-changing turn for Holmes' and Watson's relationship. [Possible spoilers following]

Since Natalie Dormer left ""Game of Thrones"", it has been rumored she could return to Elementary as Moriarty. It would not be hard to arrange for a story arc that sees her breaking out of prison and trying to re-enter her twisted relationship as ""only love"" and ""arch enemy"" with Holmes. As a culmination of her attempt to reunite with Holmes, Moriarty turns against Watson - the ground he has built his new identity on. Putting Watson out of the game is Moriarty's only way to possibly get back into Holmes' life. Watson is severly injuried in an explosion initiated by Moriarty. Holmes is weakened by the realisation that he caused the vulnerability of his best friend, but he reflects on his love - of any kind whatsoever - for her. He recognizes there is only one way the life he built with Watson's help - and to stop Moriarty from finishing her plan to kill Watson - is to take her out of the game for good.

I came up with the cliffhanger for this scenario before I plotted out the events that lead to it: The same explosion that intended to kill Watson made him temporarily limp. Holmes, injured, devastated by the situation, considers taking heroine again. The tension of his inner struggle is not resolved on-screen. The scene cuts to where Moriarty is hiding. She gets shot in the back several times. Shortly afterwards, a hooded, limping man leaves the scene.

Possible connections to Doyle's original character - an aspect the show should always try to respect - could be made with ""The Final Problem"" (Moriarty's death), ""The Empty House"" (Holmes' return), and the several occasions Holmes shows how much he holds his friend's life dear (which, of course, are always returned by Watson's steadfast willingness to stay at Holmes' side).

What do you think of this idea? Do you consider it would go to far for Holmes to commit a murder? He /did/ hurt Oscar after he had kidnapped Alfredo, an event that caused his relapse. How far would he go to save Watson?

,elementary,"Is anyone else not convinced how it ended? Professor Vickner shares tons of resemblance to the real ""James Moriarty"" while Irene doesn't at all. I think Irene is just a cover up. The real James Moriarty is Vickner and have always controlled the organization. Just under those assumptions we cannot say James has actually died or been cut off the show just like that. My guess is that once again the death was ""faked"". Irene death was faked which harmed Sherlock a lot only to later reveal that she was actually alive and was ""Moriarty"". I think the same thing is happening here. The real Moriarty is Vickner and he faked his death just like Irene death was faked. 

Moriarty is smarter than Zoya Hashemi to begin with. There is 2 possibilities to this.

1) This was part of Moriarty plans to throw off Sherlock off his case. So he made a case for Sherlock in a way he would use Zoya to hunt him down and fake his death. Basically, the whole episode was Moriarty plot to mislead Sherlock into ""hunting"" him. We can easily say he was first to be notified as he probably had connections in the FBI as stated.

2) He worked out a deal with Sherlock father to have Zoya's head. He's also using Sherlock father now just like he used his girl friend which is why James made him ""head"" of the organization. His father is notably too weak and Sherlock said this himself.

What's for sure is that this end doesn't satisfy the original story in the books. Irene wont harm Sherlock even if he gets in the way of her business. The series will eventually follow like in the books where Sherlock faces off versus Moriarty and supposedly dies. For this the real Moriarty has to exist and can't be killed like this.

They didn't show him being actually murder and just working out a deal with his father. I just know, being a Sherlock fan, that this show wont end Moriarty death so simple and easy.

She does not like conversations, perfering to write - but it&amp;#39;s perfect, i think that text communications are way better because they letting you time to think and re-write what you want to say if you want to say more. And i quess (but that&amp;#39;s only my quess) that she will never be attracted by usual human life goals like becoming rich, having a family, being respectable and in any other ways doing only what others are saying not because they want to, but because it&amp;#39;s usual and expected social behavior and they want to be just like the rest. Actually, i think that she would care mostly about her calling, do only things that she likes and enjoys to do, and totaly will unserstand others who want only the same life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad that if you will read the articles written by the people who are knowing real people with autism - you will discover that they are nothing like people with autism in movies are games, that their images are just being romanticized so public can accept them better... But just imagine, that a real person is just like i described above (even if it will never happen) - how much better life could be with someone like her? &lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"Ok I'm new to the series as I'm a big Sherlock fan but seeing I'll have to wait another year for something new I thought I might finally give Elementary a try to tide me over. Also I saw that the reviews for the series were generally favorable, so I thought I'd give it a go.

First few episodes were not bad at all I thought; I liked the fresh new take on Sherlock Holmes and all the ways that it's NOT Sherlock.

Until episode 6, where they all of a sudden seem to need to revert to CSI-like tropes like zooming in on a security camera image to recognize the brand on someone's t-shirt and getting instant access to someone's voice-mail by putting their SD card into another phone...

I find this rather disappointing for a series that at first sight, I thought, was trying to be at least a bit smarter than the average American crime series. Instead, the writers didn't seem to have to wait long before resorting back to these well known, too tired, physically impossible plot devices such as mentioned above.

I like it when a TV series doesn't try to insult my intelligence.

Is the rest of the series going to be more like this? Because if so, I'll know I won't have to be spending the time to watch it.

WGN America has cracked the case of “Elementary,” acquiring rerun rights to CBS’ detective drama.

The Tribune Co. cabler’s deal for the Sherlock Holmes’ procedural follows on the heels of its purchase of rights to another CBS drama, “Person of Interest,” from Warner Bros. TV. The deals are part of the effort by the new regime at Tribune to make over WGN America into a home for original and acquired drama series.

The WGN America pact also ensures that “Elementary,” now in its second year, will be renewed for a third season on CBS (not that there was much doubt). The rerun window on WGN America is expected to begin after the show wraps its junior year on the network. “Person of Interest” reruns are also skedded to bow in 2015.

I think this is ridiculous! Absolute nonsense! Platonic partners who live together, work together, raise a child together and love each other? Sounds like a married couple who never got their honeymoon. And so unrealistic too. Is Elementary Rob Doherty's response to When Harry Met Sally?

Upon looking at the lyrics of the song, however, we discover that it is much more than a soundtrack, and that this was only the first of countless occasions where Elementary plays a song that fits perfectly into the context.

The song is called ""Young Blood"", by ""The Naked And Famous"". The part that plays starts ""The bittersweet between my teeth, trying to find the in-betweens..."". While I don't exactly understand the meaning of this sentence (which is to say explanations are more than welcome), the onset of the original song is very meaningful. It starts as follows: 'We're only young and naive still, we require certain skills..."". Although this part does not play in the show, I cannot be convinced that the music choice is a pure coincidence.

Considering the general theme of growth and development in the show and the huge contrast between what the show opens with versus what it closes with regarding the personalities of its characters, the onset of the song is a perfect and delicious choice. ""We're only young and naive still"", Joan and Sherlock are far from naive, but in the shadow of what kind of people they will become gradually through the show, the word can be relatively applicable. Also, neither of the two is particularly young, but they grow almost 12 years during the show, which also makes the word 'young' relatively applicable. The following part, ""We require certain skills"", foreshadows the skills Sherlock and Joan are destined to develop during the course of their partnership, namely and mainly those skills of deduction and detection of Joan, and those of social adaptation and self-containment of Sherlock.

Below are full lyrics of the song:

We're only young and naïve still

We require certain skills

The mood it changes like the wind

Hard to control when it begins

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws

Claw my way out through these walls

One temporary escape

Feel it start to permeate

We lie beneath the stars at night

Our hands gripping each other tight

You keep my secrets hope to die

Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As it withers, brittle it shakes

Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?

As you shiver, count up all your mistakes

Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late

Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

The bittersweet between my teeth

Trying to find the in-betweens

Fall back in love eventually

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The bittersweet between my teeth

Can you whisper?

Trying to find the in-betweens

Can you whisper?

Fall back in love eventually

Can you whisper?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

&amp;#x200B;

I can also remember the song from S02E01 as the duo are entering London in a black cab, the song play ""I don't feel as if I know you..."", in an expression to Sherlock's recent Esrtangment from his hometown.

Anyway, so The Office community, Sherlock community, Spider-Man community, and many others are themed with a profile picture and a cover. This makes it look ten times nicer and better. It also helps in setting a very nice place that is deserving of our favorite show. 

So, if anyone knows something I don't know about that, or if any of the two moderators read that, please try to do something about it. 

It is worth mentioning that I am usually perfectionist enough to look for the best pictures possible for situations like this, so I can help to reduce the difficulty of choosing some good pictures.

Where Sherlock and Watson first meet and the first thing he says to her face is a line that he had just memorized in his memory game  - sorry, ""it's not a game, it's an exercise. I remember"". So, I had, in the past, tried several times probably to find out what TV show was that Sherlock Holmes quoted when he said **""Do you believe in love at first sight? I know what you're thinking; the world is a cynical place and I must be a cynical man, thinking that a woman like you would fall for a line like that. Thing is, it isn't a line. So, please hear me when I say, that I have never loved anyone as I do you, right now, at this moment""**. However, I was never able to find any satisfying results in my internet research. I know that ""curiosity killed the cat"", but I'd really love to know, especially that the actress is oddly familiar to me if I am not mistaken. I don't know what the odds are that anyone would know, but if anyone does, then, by all means, enlighten me. Thanks.

Do you remember this scene from the pilot? Where Sherlock and Watson first meet and the first thing he says to her face is a line that he had just memorized in his memory game  - sorry, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not a game, it&amp;#39;s an exercise. I remember&amp;quot;. So, I had, in the past, tried several times probably to find out what TV show was that Sherlock Holmes quoted when he said &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Do you believe in love at first sight? I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking; the world is a cynical place and I must be a cynical man, thinking that a woman like you would fall for a line like that. Thing is, it isn&amp;#39;t a line. So, please hear me when I say, that I have never loved anyone as I do you, right now, at this moment&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, I was never able to find any satisfying results in my internet research. I know that &amp;quot;curiosity killed the cat&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;d really love to know, especially that the actress is oddly familiar to me if I am not mistaken. I don&amp;#39;t know what the odds are that anyone would know, but if anyone does, then, by all means, enlighten me. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,elementary,"So we know the original story ""His last bow"" and it is clear that ""bow"" in this context is a metaphor. But what exactly the metaphor that ""bow"" can serve in English is not quite clear to me. I had thought earlier that it could have been a reference from the late Conan Doyle to the bow of Holmes's violin, and that this way the word ""bow"" would probably mean ""the final melody played in his career"", so to speak. It sounded like a plausible interpretation, but there was noting to confirm it. With the Elementary series finale being titled ""Their Last Bow"", however, I started to wonder. It seemed that ""bow"" here is either a mere reference to the original story or that the word itself has a fixed metaphorical meaning in English that I could not find on Google. Generally, I do understand what the word is supposed to mean in the context; an event, a phase, a telling of a story, but I would be very much interested to know that the word ""bow"" does indeed have a fixed metaphorical meaning; and if so, where does it come from and what is the explanation?   
Thanks to all the beautiful Elementary fans in advance.

Sherlock stops at the door and looks puzzled. ‘Detective I fail to see why you would need our help. A dinner party turned heated argument, a thorough canvassing of Mr Watanabes life and a matching of the prints will produce the killer.’ Sherlock gestures with his hands, ‘It’s all a bit mundane is it not?’

Bell looks exasperated, ‘I didnt ask you here to help with the murder, I asked you here to see this.’ Bell gestures at the kitchen table.

Sherlock and Joan look at each other and head to the kitchen table. Bell opens the laptop that was sitting on the table. The screen blinks into life and pictures of Sherlock and Joan appear on the screen.

Watson gasps.

‘To continue the cooking metaphor Watson, the plot has indeed thickened’

Cut to the brownstone.

Sherlock stands by his printer waiting for a new sheet to finish. Taking the sheet he proceeds to the wall of evidence display and pins it up. Watson comes in and stands next to Sherlock.

‘Mr Wantanabe was a moderator for an online forum only recently created. They have taken to calling themselves the irregular irregulars. A group dedicated to finding out more about us and our work.’

‘Well that is creepy’

‘Indeed Watson, despite our best efforts to avoid the limelight it would appear word of our exploits is now grist for the cheap voyeurism that passes for entertainment.’

Watson walks up to the display and reads off of one sheet, ‘“Joan Watson’s top five outfits. Is Joan Sherlocks lover.” We need to stop this.’

‘Fear not Watson by the end of this case I will have dismantled this group and returned our lives to the privacy we are due. I will not let some secret cabal of internet sleuths put our lives on display for their own edification.’

‘Where do we start?’

Sherlock rips down one particular sheet and hands it to Joan.

Joan reads then looks up at  Sherlock, ‘Harlan Emple gave them an interview?!’

‘I believe it is time we paid Harlan a visit and gave him a refresher on what the word secrecy should mean.’

Cut to cab ride.

Sherlock's phone rings and is placed on speaker phone. ‘Detective?’

‘Hey prints came back and you're not going to believe this. These prints have been turning up at crime scenes for the last few years. FBI have profiled this killer to be an international assassin. Their M.O. is to use everyday items to kill the victims. Seems Mr wantanabe must be mixed up with some pretty powerful players.’

‘Watson and I are on route to an irregular who may have some information. We will keep you apprised of what we find.’

Sherlock puts the phone away. ‘It may be time to reassess my relationship with Mr Emple.’

Cut to Harlan Emple’s apartment block.

Sherlock and Joan approach the door and notice it is open. Sherlock slows and nods at Joan. Joan takes out her baton and extends it with a flick of the wrist. Sherlock presses himself to the wall and edges up to the door. With one hand he pushes the door open and quickly takes a peek. Then, when nothing happens, they both enter. 

‘Harlan?’ asks Sherlock loudly.

Harlan's apartment is trashed.

‘Looks like there was a struggle.’ notes Watson.

Sherlock kneels down to examine the flecks of blood on the ground.

‘Sherlock.’, Watson is pointing to the table. On the table is a note with Sherlock's name on. Watson reads the note. ‘I knew you would arrive first.

,elementary,"Rather than introducing a completely new villain in the final season and ultimately leaving the Moriarty arc open-ended, wouldn't a better idea have been to center the whole final season around Moriarty? They already started building up something in season six. Why not continue it throughout the season seven, until the final showdown?


In the interview, Robert Doherty explained that they didn't even try getting Natalie Dormer to appear in the finale, fearing that the Moriarty arc would take the attention away from Sherlock and Joan. *But the entire final season-up until the final episode-was focused on all that master villain plot anyway.* Only the final episode was (mostly) all about Sherlock, Joan, their partnership etc. Why not have that villain be Moriarty, rather than Odin Reichenbach, who we had never seen before? They could have still found a way to tie up the Moriarty arc by the episode twelve, and then focus on Sherlock and Joan, and the aftermath, in the final episode.


I know that Moriarty actually wasn't *that* big of a deal in the original stories, and was only created as a plot device to kill Sherlock off. But ""Elementary"" turned her into an extremely interesting and multilayered character, and Natalie Dormer was great in that role. If any villain deserved to be the focus of the final season, it was Moriarty. They didn't necessarily have to kill her off or even incarcerate her for life at the end, just develop an actual plot from all that build-up in the previous season and provide some closure.

To be fair, the writers kind of wrote themselves into a corner, because they established (pretty early on) that Moriarty would never actually kill Sherlock or Joan. They are the only two people that can match up her wits and intelligence. Moriarty has always been their foe, but never really their threat. But she was still willing to have Sherlock's father killed in order to get her organization back, and they teased her return throughout season six (and seven). So I'm sure that the writers could have figured something out.

And what was the point of Joan adopting a kid? Knowing how busy she is, he will probably end up being raised by a nanny more often than not.


Also, why did Moriarty fake her death? To get away from her enemies? To get Sherlock and Joan to let their guard down? To get back at Sherlock for doing the same?


There were only four good things about the finale IMO:


• Joan having finally written and published ""The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes""

• the way Moriarty lured Sherlock out of hiding was clever, sneaky, and it really seemed like something she would do (too bad that didn't lead anywhere)

• seeing agent McNally back was nice

• the ending, with ""As long as we're together, what does it matter?""

'He wanted to fly before breakfast' says Sherlock matter of factly.

Watson sighs and heads for the coffee machine, 'Clyde told you that?'

'It is obvious what Clyde wants, if one is willing to listen.'

Sherlock's mobile phone rings, 'Detective?....we will be on our way.'

Cut to apartment





Sherlock and Watson enter the apartment and head to the kitchen. Detective Bell and several other cops are inspecting the crime scene. The body of a dead man lies in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor.

'Victim is Takeshi Watanabe, this is his flat, no murder weapon has turned up. No signs of forced entry so I figure he must have known the person that stabbed him. Stab wound looks weird though, it wasn't made with a knife.'

Sherlock stands over the body examining the details. Looking up Sherlock moves over to the pots on the stove. 

Bell looks at him quizzically, 'you hungry?'

'This pot is still warm', Sherlock opens the pot and acrid smoke drifts out, 'its boiled dry, was the burner still on when you arrived?'

Bell checks his notes, 'yeah responding unit came after a report of smoke and found our victim. They turned the stove off, figured the victim was stabbed while cooking.'

Sherlock takes a deep smell of the burnt food and smiles. Moving back to the victim Sherlock gets on his knees and takes a deep smell of the victims stab wound. Bell looks on horrified at Holmes.

'No detective Mr Wantanabe wasn't stabbed while cooking, the murderer left that pot on.'

'The killer cooked some food before fleeing? That doesn't make sense Holmes.'

'No detective, the wound, it smells of fish.'

'He was stabbed with a fish?' says Bell disbelievingly.

'Exactly, but not just any fish, Katsuobushi.'

'Katsuobushi… that's a Japanese dried fermented fish' says Joan.

'Yes,' Sherlock replies, 'usually added to meals as shaved flakes but in its original form it is renowned as one of the hardest foods. Perfectly adequate to stab someone with...'

'...and the murderer left the fish boiling in the pot to destroy the evidence…'

'Exactly Watson' turning to Bell, 'I might suggest you dust the pot for fingerprints.'

'I will get CSU on it' turning away Bell makes a call on his radio.

'Do you see Watson, a good detective needs a range of skills to solve crimes.'

'Did you write a monograph on identifying dried fish?'

If you haven't watched S07, stop reading.

I got into the show pretty late (Aug 2019) but I have been watching almost daily and finally finished today. 

Honestly, I loved this show. I didn't have any serious problems with the show until I watched S07. I don't know where to start, there's many threads discussing why finale was underwhelming, etc but I want to rant about one thing that i find super annoying.

Moriarty plot.

Up until her appearance on my screen, I had never watched Natalie Dormer. Many of you might be surprised but it is what it is. I was completely blown away by her performance. Acting felt authentic and her scenes with Sherlock were amazing. She's my favourite character.

The frustrating part is, she just disappears. While watching right till the end I was always waiting for her. How would Sherlock and her paths cross again? What did she want from Sherlock (and Joan)? I was expecting at least a cameo once in a season or maybe a regular full season role. 

Then there's Producer Rob Doherty explaining his [seriously dumb reason](https://i.imgur.com/dncQB9o.png) I mean why would you keep banging the Moriarty drum if you have no intention of bringing her back? Make up something like:  
1.  Morland dismantled the group. Group is too weak, M is now only dealing in art.  
2. Or when Morland dies, Sherlock becomes the head, he fights with Moriarty for control of the group.  

You get my point, the possibilities with this show are endless.

My understanding on the matter is Dormer is simply too expensive and they couldn't afford her. I can't think of any other reason to not include her.

,elementary,"Spoilers, obviously. Don’t read if you haven’t seen S7, E13 and the rest of S7.

So, I _just_ finished binging season 7, and I thought the season, _overall_, was **fantastic**. There was so much tension built up with a variety of sub-plots. The whole Odin chaotic good supercriminal anti-hero thingamajig, Sherlock’s father dying, and a surprising return of Moriarty, someone we hadn’t heard from in a long while. I was so damn excited seeing Moriarty be mentioned again. Would we see the return of Natalie Dormer? Well, most likely not. I believe she confirmed she didn’t have time to return to the show a while back. And besides, wasn’t Moriarty’s plot resolved anyway? Why bring it back in the first place, especially when it’s left with so much unresolved tension? Come to think of it, it really doesn’t make much sense to bring this subplot back when they couldn’t even get the original actress to return, and even still, they could’ve done _something_ with it. I’m _still_ confused as to what the whole Moriarty subplot was about in this season’s last one or two episodes, and I just finished watching them.

But the last few episodes of the season, especially the season finale (E13), wrap it up so awkwardly. Moriarty is back, and, like, an episode later, there’s a one-year time skip, and suddenly, Moriarty’s dead. But she’s _not_ dead, according to Sherlock—obviously. She faked her death! How intriguing! And that’s it. The season’s over. We’re not getting a season 8. That’s quite the cliffhanger there.

There’s also the whole NSA Agent McNally ordeal. The wrap-up with that subplot felt very rushed. The NSA has taken part in inhumane crimes, and Agent McNally saw no repercussions for what he’d done. Now he’s trying to recruit Sherlock. Sherlock denies it, and that’s it, apparently.

I love Elementary. It’s one of my favourite shows. But the season 7 finale felt pretty underwhelming. I feel like there are a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of things that left me wanting. A Sherlock Holmes show without Sherlock faking his death at one point wouldn’t be a Sherlock Holmes show—it’s a classic! But in the end, he just walks as a free man. Sherlock faking his death _was_ exciting, but I felt like it solved everything much more quickly than it should’ve.

And what about the Joan having cancer thing? One minute, we, along with Sherlock, find out that Joan has cancer in an eye-watering scene. The next minute, it’s a year later, and she’s cancer-free. What’s that about? With the cancer thing, the Agent McNally resolution, the Joan/Moriarty funeral fake-out, and so on, it feels like the show’s creators had a competition for who could crowd the finale with as many lead-ups, twists, and conclusions as humanly possible.

Honestly, I just feel like season 7 was rushed. It started off so great, and the majority of the season was fantastic, but to me, I get the feeling that the creators of the show realized they were running out of budget and just wanted to get it done as soon as possible. This is made clear by the fact that season 7 only had 13 episodes, whereas all other seasons of the show had 24 episodes, except season 6, which had 21 episodes, and that’s still a lot more than 13.

This post has a lot of rambling, but I hope my points get across at least in some way. To sum it up: While I loved season 7, I did not love the finale. It felt rushed. It felt like I was left hanging. I didn’t feel satisfied like I did when I watched season 6’s finale. Despite how much I enjoyed season 7 as a whole, I almost wish that the show ended on season 6. Now, _that_ was a satisfying ending. All the answers about &gt;!the entire Michael serial killer subplot that went on throughout the entire season!&lt; were answered, and it felt like Joan and Sherlock had a whole new adventure in front of them. That’s what a season finale _should_ be. Not one with rushed twists and conclusions, unanswered questions, and just overall confusion.

,elementary,"To be clear, I love Elementary.  I've read and watched Sherlock Holmes for decades, and I've never cared much for it.  Sherlock was usually less a character than a caricature, and Watson was rarely more than a useless buffoon.  Sherlock stories were good for a bit of fun but not anything I could get invested in.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came Elementary.  This show did so many things that impressed me I couldn't begin to list them all, but the most important was the characters.  For the first time, Sherlock and Watson felt like actual people.  Heck, the people around them felt more fleshed out and compelling than Sherlock and Watson had ever been before.  The writing, the casting, the acting, all made for something I could never have imagined.  Even Moriaty, a lazy and boring character (evil mirrors of characters always are) in the source material became intriuging.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on for ages praising the show, but this is what Season 7 got wrong.  Not with the main cast, with the villain.  From the moment he was introduced, Odin was portrayed as brilliant.  Sherlock's first comments on him are to say he's downplaying his genius.  Throughout the season, we're told he's the biggest and most threatening villain ever, able to influence governments and take down the leader of Moriarty's organization.  And on top of that, we're told about how he even had an interesting motive.

&amp;#x200B;

But the writing shows all of that to be a lie.  Odin wasn't smart.  He wasn't clever.  We weren't shown a single thing to justify the hype.  Aside from the trick he played before they knew he was a bad guy, Odin didn't fool Sherlock a single time.  Not only did he fail to trick Sherlock, each time he tried, he failed miserably.  The only reason Odin posed any sort of threat was he had magic powers.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean that literally.  Computer hacking in Elementary was never realistic, but usually it was unimportant to the plot.  Yeah, the NSA hacked into their PCs to hijack a livestream and delete files from their harddrive, which is impossible, but I can forgive that.  The same thing could have been done by having agents show up at the brownstone.  Similarly, Everyone being able to hack into servers to get information on a whim is completely unrealistic, but that information could have been gathered in other ways that'd have taken a bit more screen time.  It's lazy writing, but it's forgivable because it doesn't change anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are different in Season 7.  Odin's impossible to believe hacking tools are central to the season's plot.  Having the villain of the season be based entirely on lazy writing is a problem.  Odin wants to talk to Sherlock but can't risk being recorded?  Just give him a magic device that magically disables electronics in the area, a tool which never showed up before or again after.  Odin gets targeted by Moriarty's group and loses the season-long struggle?  Just give him magic powers that let him frighten the powerful criminal organization he never even knew existed so much they immediately surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

THe worst thing is to make this lazy writing work, our characters have to be turned into idiots.  Defeating Odin could have been as simple as telling the world he uses his position to spy on people for purposes of insider trading.  We see with Morland's plans if Odin loses the protection of his company, he can go to jail.  So... tell the world.  Heck, frame him if necessary.  We saw once an investigation began Odin lost so... why not frame him for insider trading.  Heck, tell the world he kills people who gets in the way of business deals.  It's the truth, and even just the rumor of it would ruin Odin's plans.

&amp;#x200B;

I could rant for ages about this.  Everything about Odin was lazy and dumb.  The writers couldn't come up with a threatening villain so they resorted to magic in the form of, ""He has technology.""  We never see anything from Odin that is smart, clever or dangerous beyond, ""I have magic.""  When confronted with Morland, he wins because magic.  Then he somehow loses with an idiotic plan that shouldn't have ever worked.  Then we have the finale which is filled with things like, ""I relapsed; I got better"" and, ""I got cancer; I got better.""  And remember how Morland was told Odin was a new thing, making Moriarty's organization a dionsaur?  Yeah, despite that and despite Sherlock fighting it for three years, somehow Moriarty's organization is thriving.  Morland died for no reason.  It was just to make Odin seem scarier with his magical powers... that somehow failed him in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good things about Season 7.  Miss Understood is one of my favorite episodes.  The acting in the finale made me want to tear up.  There are plenty more examples, but Season 6 ended with pure idiocy as nobody could have ever believed Watson was guilty, and Season 7 took that idiocy and ran with it as hard as it could.

To some extent I agree it did wrap up nicely in season 6 but i consider season 7 like an extra treat after a full course meal. This might be a terrible analogy but even after the full binge of 1-6 i had room for a little more just to be greedy.  The ending didn&amp;#39;t feel like a real final but i&amp;#39;m glad it didn&amp;#39;t.

If i had to point to something that bothered me the most, id say that i feel like we werent really given an end to a Story. There is absolutely no reason ended. I mean i get that TV Shows end, but in universe it feels like more or less an arbitrary cut off point.

,elementary,"I found the following passage in a book of essays by W. H. Auden, which I thought might be of interest to members of this subreddit:

&gt;All characters who are products of the mythopoeic imagination are instantaneously recognizable by the fact that their existence is not defined by their social and historical context; transfer them to another society or another age and their characters and behavior will remain unchanged. In consequence, once they have been created, they cease to be their author's characters and become the reader’s; he can continue their story for himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anna Karenina is not such a character for the reader cannot imagine her apart from the particular milieu in which Tolstoy places her or the particular history of her life which he records; Sherlock Holmes, on the other hand, is: every reader, according to his fancy, can imagine adventures for him which Conan Doyle forgot, as it were, to tell us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tolstoy was a very great novelist, Conan Doyle a very minor one, yet it is the minor not the major writer who possesses the mythopoeic gift. The mythopoeic imagination is only accidentally related, it would seem, to the talent for literary expression; in Cervantes' *Don Quixote* they are found together, in Rider Haggard's *She* literary talent is largely absent. Indeed, few of the writers whom we call great have created mythical characters. In Shakespeare's plays we find five, Prospero, Ariel, Caliban, Falstaff and Hamlet, and Hamlet is a myth for actors only; the proof that, for actors, he is a myth is that all of them without exception, irrespective of age, build, or even sex, wish to play the part.  
&gt;  
&gt;After Cervantes, as a writer who combines literary talent and a mythopoeic imagination, comes Dickens and, of his many mythical creations, Mr. Pickwick is one of the most memorable. Though the appeal of mythical characters transcends all highbrow-lowbrow frontiers of taste, it is not unlimited; every such character is symbolic of some important and perpetual human concern, but a reader must have experienced this concern, even if he cannot define it to himself, before the character can appeal to him.

,elementary,"Hello Fellow...

Alright, look. I don't want to get too emotional but... Nope. I'm going to anyways. Lets get the basics out of the way.

Synopsis- Amidst Holmes and Watson's battle with tech billionaire Odin Reichenbach, the duo receives word of their old enemy and Sherlock's former love, Jamie Moriarty.

So, now let's talk. Listen, this show has been a big part of my life for about 7 years. It started in the first year of my relationship, and I just got married in May! I have so much attachment and I just feel really glad to have been here and shared this show with all you guys. Its been amazing. I grew up with a big old book shelf full of books at my grandparents' house and every summer I would take a Sherlock Holmes book down and read from the time I could barely make out the words(so basically, 3 weeks ago! Ha...)

I've loved these characters. As I became a mod here and later an admin, I loved watching you guys share in it. I've somehow been quoted by blogs and had a bit of my name out in this fandom and met a LOT of fantastic people through this show(all of you, honestly.).

With that said, after this episode is done tonight, I hope you keep coming back. If possible I would like to do 3 things with this sub going forward: 

1.Do a full series weekly rewatch that'll take 3 years.

2.Do an eventual conversion to a greater scope Sherlock Holmes sub that specializes in Elementary and holds this show in the same regard it always has

3.Find new ways to keep this fandom going somehow. Maybe through art or an event or even a charity fundraiser for addiction. Feel free to post some ideas you have here.

But yeah, if you are still so inclined, please keep your eyes on this sub in the post-show. Thanks so much for everything! It was truly an honor to meet you all.

,elementary,"Last night I was watching an old rerun of Elementary and I just became overwhelmed with melancholy. It used to be fun reliving old episodes that I've seen a thousand times. But I started thinking about how that's all it will ever be now. I'll never see them tackle a new case again. Never see a new one of Sherlock's adorable facial expressions, or hear a funny verbal one. Once the finale airs, I'm unsure if I'll be able to watch reruns for a while because they're going to remind me that it's over and bring me sorrow as opposed to the usual joy the show used to bring.

,elementary,"There are several fairly common thematic/genre episodes that I think would have worked really well in ""Elementary"", but they never gave them a try. Some of the missed opportunities are:


 • Halloween episode [Featuring a creepy, complicated case with lots of twists and turns, exploring the possibility of supernatural because duh. Of course, it all has a rational explanation at the end.]

• Christmas episode [It could encourage Sherlock and Joan to discuss religion, and provoke Sherlock to rant about consumerism.]

• Valentine's Day episode [Possible set-up: both Sherlock and Joan have a date scheduled for the Valentine's Day (though with Sherlocj it is maybe more like an arrangement with a call girl). But an important and complicated case comes their way, and they work around the clock to solve it before the Valentine's Day evening. In the end, they do solve the case, but it is too late, and they have both missed their date. They spend the evening watching the old movies together on the rooftop.]

• Anthology episode [Where Sherlock and/or Joan talk about several different cases they have solved together, and the events are told via flashbacks. Bonus points if all the cases mentioned took place over the summer, during the show's hiatus, with Sherlock or Joan remarking: ""Strangely enough, we don't get that many cases in summer."" All of the mysteries could be the adaptations of the original ACD short stories. The set-up could be Sherlock talking about that during a sobriety meeting. He was shown doing that at the beginning of 1x15 ""A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs"", where he told them about the case from one of the original ACD stories, ""The Adventure of the Crooked Man"". Then he suggested telling them about the case of the ""blue carbuncle"".]

• The 9/11 tribute episode [Clearly more somber and serious than the other suggestions, but an interesting theme-the show does take place in the New York City, after all.]


I have been thinking about CSI: New York, another quirky and interesting crime procedural that took place in the New York City (well, duh). They did all of the thematic/genre episodes mentioned above (some of them multiple times), and even some more (such as the one exploring the horrors and impact of the Holocaust, or the one that include the voice-over of the murder victim), and they were all great episodes. It saddens me that ""Elementary"" never gave any of them a try. Though many crime procedural features at least one of such episodes so it is not really original, I think it would have worked really well here. ""Elementary"" definitely had the potential to expand on its quirkiness and ""break the format"" from time to time, but they rarely did anything different. They would include lots of interesting real-life elements/trends/discoveries (mostly in relation to science and popular culture) into almost every episode, but in the end, they were all typical crime procedural episodes in tone and format.

 It's usually what makes a show or a film bad, when you need to make explanations as to what is going on. The problem here is that you don't even have to do that - one example I just watched is someone is found to have a married name and Watson jumps in to say 'you weren't hiding the truth from your employer, you were trying to hide your adultery from your husband' - it was very unnatural since it was so straightforward as to what the implication was that no one in the scene needed for that to be articulated, I resent the fact that the writers think that the people who watch Sherlock are the laziest and stupidest individuals who need everything basic occurrence on the show narrated. It actually takes away the pleasure of watching this show from me a little bit, because I find the show to be condescending to the viewer (and I have no problem with explanations that are needed, I have a problem with the most basic statements that are very clear to everyone who is watching, but the producers feel the need to highlight through someone's words).

,elementary,"Elementary to me has been one of the best Sherlock Holmes series there is. I love this series as much as i loved Jeremy Brett's Sherlock, not overlooking the first two season of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock but i love Elementary more. The cases that come up with each episode is some of the most intelligent writing i have seen from a long runnning crime show. 

And ofcourse, there is Lucy Liu(playing Watson) and Johnny Lee Miller(playing Sherlock) who have just embodied the characters perfectly. 

Miller playing a consultant detective with demons of his own,struggling with his addiction, seeing how Lucy Liu's Watson has just eased him into his life in New York which Sherlock ends up cherishing so much has been a treat and has played the role of Sherlock with absolute and sincere conviction.Detective Marcus played by Jon Michael Hill has been a gem, the respect Sherlock and Watson have for him is just beautiful to watch. Caption Gregson played by Aidan Quinn has been great, a friend in need and a character who is wise and at the same time flawed.

Last but not the least, Lucy Liu, for me she is the best Watson that there can be, she is the invisible fabric that holds up this show.

Everytime i watch an episode i get the same feeling when i first started reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, which for me is more than i could hope for and doing it for 7 seasons.

&lt;p&gt;Everytime i watch an episode i get the same feeling when i first started reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, which for me is more than i could hope for and doing it for 7 seasons. A Sherlock Holmes adaptation with some sincerity, appreciation and intelligent writing to extend the original material is more than i could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Elementary is how Sherlock Holmes should have been adapted for Television.&lt;/p&gt;
